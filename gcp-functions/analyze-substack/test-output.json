  "bio": "A seasoned CTO and three-time AI startup co-founder (Paxton AI, ZestyAI, and a new stealth venture) with a background in consulting at McKinsey. They are passionate about the practical application of AI, product-led growth (PLG), and the intricacies of founder psychology.\n\nTheir perspective is shaped by hands-on experience building AI products from the ground up. They write analytical yet personal \"field notes\" on topics ranging from go-to-market strategy and audience-building to the human side of entrepreneurship and using AI for creative pursuits. They often explore the trade-offs in product strategy, the importance of community, and the vulnerable, psychological realities of being a founder.\n\nBased in Bend, Oregon, they are an avid explorer, often found outdoors with their husband and two dogs."
