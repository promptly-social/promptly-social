It feels a lot like how some customers treat SaaS products.\n\nThey use you, but they aren't committed. They haven't moved in. They haven't integrated your product into the core of their daily workflow. This is the biggest threat to retention.\n\nIt's not just about preventing churn. It's about turning casual users into true partners who can't imagine their work without you. That requires moving them from a 'situationship' to a real commitment.\n\nAs Elena Verna brilliantly breaks down, we need to get better at spotting the signs of low-commitment and actively guide users toward deeper engagement.\n\nWhat are the signs you look for to see if a customer is truly 'committed' vs. just casually dating your product?\n\nRead more here: https://www.elenaverna.com/p/retention-the-situationship-of-saas\n\n#SaaS #ProductManagement #CustomerRetention",

They're trying to build the entire stadium that everyone else will play in.\n\nBy open-sourcing Llama 3, they're giving away the 'secret sauce' for free. Why?\n\nIt's a grand chess move. It's not about selling the AI itself. It's about commoditizing the model layer to control the ecosystem.\n\n1. It makes their framework the industry standard.\n2. It accelerates development on their terms.\n3. It creates a massive talent pool familiar with their tools.\n\nThis positions them to win on other fronts, like the hardware for AI (selling more Quest headsets) and attracting the best research talent. It’s a bold, long-term play for platform dominance.\n\nI break down the thinking in my latest post.\n\nIs Meta's open-source strategy a brilliant long-term play or a risky gamble against competitors like OpenAI and Google? I'd love to hear your take.\n\nFull analysis: https://www.generativevalue.com/p/metas-ai-strategy\n\n#AI #BusinessStrategy #Meta",

    "linkedin_post": "I once challenged myself to create and launch 10 digital products. It was an experiment in action over perfection.\n\nMost of them went nowhere.\n\nBut the lessons I learned were more valuable than any single success would have been.\n\nHere are a few quick takeaways:\n\n- Volume teaches you what perfection can't. Shipping 10 times gives you 10x the feedback and insight.\n\n- Distribution is half the battle. You can have the best product in the world, but if no one sees it, it’s just a file on your computer.\n\n- Your first idea is just a starting line. The real magic happens when you adapt based on what you learn after you launch.\n\nThe goal wasn't to get rich quick. It was to get smart quick.\n\nFor anyone who builds, creates, or has a side project: What's the biggest lesson you've learned from something that *didn't* work out?\n\nRead the other lessons here: https://writebuildscale.substack.com/p/10-lessons-from-creating-10-digital\n\n#Entrepreneurship #CreatorEconomy #Startups",
