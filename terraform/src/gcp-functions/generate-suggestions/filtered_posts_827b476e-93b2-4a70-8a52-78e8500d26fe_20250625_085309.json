Maybe not the first time <em>posting became policy</em>, but it’s hard to find a clearer example. I was in the middle of the grocery store grabbing bananas when I got the notification, which just underscored how strange and disorienting this all is. </p><div

href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-25/new-yorkers-withstand-scorching-heat-to-choose-mayoral-candidate?srnd=homepage-americas\">Zohran Mamdani won the NYC Democratic Mayoral Primary</a>, a highly contested race that he ran with sheer narrative discipline and command of the digital. Even if you don’t like his policies (I think many of them are unworkable) the campaign was good! He walked the entire length of Manhattan. He was everywhere, all the time.</p><p>And finally, a few days before both of those, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-21/andreessen-horowitz-backs-ai-startup-with-slogan-cheat-at-everything\">a startup called Cluely<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> </a>raised a $15 million round led by a16z<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a>. The company’s modus operandi is <a href=\"https://x.com/FT/status/1937518626484912447\">‘cheat on everything’. </a>Like sure, of course. But a16z didn’t invest based on that! They invested based on Cluely’s attention capture capability! Cluely is good at getting people to pay attention to them and is largely copying the enterprise Jake Paul playbook (stunts, virality, nihilism, and a vibe-first narrative) for B2C AI apps. We’ve already seen “brain-rot marketing” take over culture so it was only a matter of time before it hit the startup world.</p><p>But these three things  - geopolitical conflict, a mayoral primary, a startup raise - are indicators of something I want to tie a thread through in this piece:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Attention is infrastructure</strong>: Determines what gets funded, elected, or build</p></li><li><p><strong>Narrative is capital</strong>: It drives flows of money, policy, and sentiment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speculation</strong> is the <strong>operating layer</strong> between the two - it’s how belief is tested, priced, and converted into outcomes <em>before</em> institutions act.</p></li></ul><p>What we’re seeing isn’t just a media trend. It’s a shift in the architecture of power. Attention → Speculation → Allocation. This is the new supply chain.</p><p>Traditional economic theory assumes information flows serve resource allocation. But increasingly, resource allocation serves attention flows. We've moved from an economy where attention supports other forms of value creation to one where attention <em>is</em> the value creation. </p><h4>How to Think About Attention</h4><p>Traditional economic substrates are land, labor, capital - bedrock inputs to make stuff. But now, the foundational input is attention. </p><p>Trump said he was going to take 2 weeks or so to think it through the Iran bombings… and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/us/politics/trump-truth-social-iran-war.html\">then just did it?</a> The NYT later reported that the decision to strike was influenced in part by how the Israeli campaign was<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/trump-iran-decision-strikes.html\"> “playing” on Fox News</a>, so Trump’s response very much felt like a reactive spectacle<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> rather than military strategy. And it played like theater!</p><ul><li><p>Iran knew Trump might do something because of his<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/trump-iran-decision-strikes.html\"> incessant posts.</a></p></li><li><p>Military officials feared that Trump’s posts were compromising operational secrecy, so they ordered a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/22/politics/maga-movement-divided-trump-iran\">diversionary B-2 flight to distract from the real mission. </a></p></li><li><p>Iran simply moved their uranium to a different spot, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/iran-uranium-stockpile-whereabouts.html\">and now we don’t seem to know where it is. </a></p></li><li><p>It seems like the bombs<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/22/nx-s1-5441734/satellites-show-damage-iran-nuclear-program-not-destroyed-experts-say\"> didn’t really hit what they were supposed to?</a></p></li><li><p>Iran retaliated a few days later by<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/iran-missile-strike-on-qatar-base-fits-de-escalation-playbook?taid=6859a79c8217380001324705&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\"> striking US Gulf bases </a>signaling to the US ahead of time that the bases would be hit (I was also in the grocery store when I found out about this one)</p></li><li><p>The fact that they didn’t close down the Strait of Hormuz is a sign that things might (?) be petering out from here (I write tentatively on the morning of June 25). </p></li><li><p>Trump called for a ceasefire, a<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/24/world/ceasefire-iran-israel-trump\">nd both Israel and Iran seem to be ignoring him</a></p></li><li><p>He said China can continue buying Iranian oil, apparently<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/trump-eases-pressure-on-iran-by-saying-china-can-buy-its-oil\"> lifting the sanctions?</a></p></li><li><p>He got <a href=\"https://x.com/cspan/status/1937468807536169315\">very mad</a> (understandably) on Live TV </p></li></ul><p>Trump only notified <em>Republican</em> members of Congress about the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/lawmakers-both-parties-question-legality-trumps-iran-strikes-rcna214316\">strikes</a>, which isn’t great. It also seems that intelligence briefings said that Iran <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-nuclear-facilities-cia\">wasn’t</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-nuclear-facilities-cia\"> actively weaponizing its nuclear program</a> (making the bombing illegal). But, when Congress is as useful as a fish flopping next to a giant body of water, the law matters less than content strategy. </p><p>Trump yet again inverted system architecture - flipping how information and decision-making traditionally flow. Military strategy and diplomacy all became subordinate to social media dynamics. But he is moving on as <a href=\"https://x.com/David_Rudnick/status/1937471865490145711\">if war is only a weekend thing</a>. As his State Department spokeswoman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/trump-eases-pressure-on-iran-by-saying-china-can-buy-its-oil\">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I’m not going to get ahead of the president or try to guess what his strategy will be. Things happen quickly and I think we’ll find out sooner than later.</p></blockquote><p>And this gets into the tricky part of the attention economy - it’s easy to get eyeballs, sure, and people will do wilder and wilder stunts to keep eyes on them. But what happens when people stop paying attention? Here, it’s that Iran will likely continue pursuing a nuclear bomb because all they have to do to understand the narrative is watch the feed, and that holds heavy, heavy consequences. </p><h4>Zohran Mamdani</h4><p>There are many great essays on Mamdani (<a href=\"https://derekthompson.substack.com/p/what-speaks-to-me-about-abundance\">Derek Thompson just joined Substack!</a>), so I won’t belabor it too much here. But yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-25/new-yorkers-withstand-scorching-heat-to-choose-mayoral-candidate?srnd=homepage-americas\">Zohran Mamdani won the NYC Democratic Mayoral Primar</a>y. A 33-year-old democratic socialist just beat a former governor - Andrew Cuomo - by running a campaign that got a lot of attention. 4.5 months ago<a href=\"https://x.com/hecubian_devil/status/1937696976315039778\"> he was polling at 1%! </a></p><p>Most of his messaging was about <a href=\"https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1878853557111414795\">affordability</a> (which is also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-climate-change-immigration-tariffs-young-voters-e4bd29e491d42fd989c32be8eeb2a2cb\">why Trump won among young voters</a>). He is a master of short-form video and podcasts, but he was also <em>physically</em> in NYC, again, walking the length of the city. Cuomo was advertising on TV and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-campaign-finance.html\">raised $25 million in the largest super PAC ever created in a NYC mayoral campaign</a> (!) but that simply didn’t matter</p><p>And as many have said, Mamdani is the most Trump-like candidate *in messaging* the left has produced - he had a deeply online campaign, he did every interview he could, he has a loyal base <a href=\"https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1937339211004154269\">(they knocked on 1.5 million doors!</a>), and clear messaging. </p><p>Mamdani proved attention is the path to institutional override. Just like Trump, but from the other side.</p><p>The shift isn’t that surprising, and it will happen more now, on both ends. People are largely frustrated with the status quo. There is excitement in rule bending, like JD Vance <a href=\"https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1937684913278370161\">sticking up a middle finger</a> or Trump dropping an F-bomb on C-Span. </p><p>The ideas matter, sure. People voted for Trump because <a href=\"https://apnews.com/projects/trump-campaign-promise-tracker/\">they wanted deportations and unwokeness </a>but also because he was different and new. Mamdani promises affordability and fresh new ideas. It feels like change in a world where people are not listened to.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> </p><h4>How They All Tie Together</h4><p>All three stories - Trump bombing Iran on social, Mamdani walking Manhattan on TikTok, Cluely’s raise - have one thing in common: the power came from attention, and attention came from narrative discipline. </p><p>It operates like a supply chain of sorts:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link

Cuomo concedes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pollution</strong>: Outrage cycles, factionalism, increased ideological sorting.</p></li></ul><p>Cluely fits this cycle too. When a16z funds Cluely based purely on attention capture capability, they're legitimizing attention as a fundable asset class. That sends a signal to every other founder - build for virality, not just utility. It’s American Dynamism!</p><p>Attention is the raw material of economic, political, and military action. But speculation is what operationalizes that attention: the bets people place (emotionally, politically, financially) on what narrative will become real. </p><p>And in politics, this type of speculation has become the closest thing to agency for people who feel like they are no longer served by the economy. People speculate on ideas, personalities, etc. Why wouldn’t they? But when this happens, you end up with a system optimized for speed and virality rather than stability or accuracy.</p><p>And I think that’s why there’s an informal coalition that controls resource allocation now - podcasters like Joe Rogan, YouTubers like Mr Beast, guys like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson. Elon Musk, who has not said one word about what's going on, is a narrative thermostat. They are masters of speed and virality. </p><p>They all take that speculation, determine what gets attention, which increasingly determines what gets resources. The world is learning from them now - startups, politicians, geopolitical strategy. The \"checks and balances\" no longer come from Congress or the courts, but from the feed. </p><h4>We’ve Been Here Before</h4><p>What I'm describing isn't entirely unprecedented, of course. Many have discussed<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a>. Back in 1971, Herbert Simon wrote in <a href=\"https://knowen-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/file/2005/DESIGNING%2BORGANIZATIONS%2Bfor%2BInformation-Rich%2Bworld%2B--%2BSImon.pdf\">Designing Organizations for an Information-Rich World</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.</p></blockquote><p>Information abundance creates attention scarcity! By 1997 (!) Michael Goldhaber was pushed this further with <a href=\"https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/519/440\">The Attention Economy and the Net </a>arguing that attention was becoming the new currency of the digital age. </p><blockquote><p>The attention economy brings with it its own kind of wealth, its own class divisions - stars vs. fans - and its own forms of property, all of which make it incompatible with the industrial-money-market based economy it bids fair to replace. Success will come to those who best accommodate to this new reality.</p></blockquote><p>Robert Shiller coined <em>narrative economics,</em> arguing that stories drive economic behavior. I think we are in a new iteration of all of this where the stories aren't just influencing economic activity, they <em>are</em> the economic activity. Attention is a precursor to wealth (in many ways) and speculation drives it. </p><p>Succinctly… everything feels like crypto now? Crypto doesn’t represent “real” value (some things in the industry do, but broad brushstrokes), but it synthesizes it through speculation and belief. Vibes, volatility, and mindshare, if you will. We're now living in a system where attention dynamics are the operating system for resource allocation, political decisions, and identity formation. </p><h4>What Comes Next</h4><p>This intersection of speculation and attention feels ignored outside of markets. And the question isn't whether we can build better housing or infrastructure - though we desperately need both. The question is whether we can build anything coherent when the resource allocation system rewards attention over everything else. </p><p>Because right now, the person who can generate the most compelling speculation about the future gets the most power to create it, regardless of whether they understand the consequences.</p><p>There's no neutral outside from which to observe these systems. We're building the tools that are rebuilding us, and it will have consequences across the board. There really isn't an offline anymore, just due to the administration. We're all participants in a cognitive economy that trades in attention, belief, and behavior. Shape the feed, shape the future. What happens when everything becomes an attention-speculation machine?</p><p><strong>Next week: Part 2,</strong> I’ll attempt to answer that question and walk through what could be built and the generational implications.

to Change Limiting Beliefs</p></li><li><p>Final Thoughts</p></li><li><p>BONUS</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>How Limiting Beliefs Are Formed</h2><p><strong>What Are Limiting Beliefs?</strong> Limiting beliefs are subconscious assumptions that restrict what we believe we’re capable of. Psychologists like Aaron Beck and researchers from PositivePsychology.com call them <em>negative core beliefs</em> or <em>dysfunctional schemas</em>. They act like mental filters—confirming your fears and filtering out success.</p><h3>Psychological Origins</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Learned Helplessness</strong>: Martin Seligman’s classic research showed that when faced with repeated failure or uncontrollable stress, both animals and humans begin to believe that nothing they do matters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Self-Schema Theory</strong>: Aaron Beck’s work shows that early life criticism, trauma, or neglect can form schemas like “I’m unlovable” or “I’m incapable.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Learning</strong>: Bandura’s research reminds us that we often internalize beliefs modeled by parents, peers, and culture—especially when combined with negative emotional experiences.</p></li></ul><h3>Neurological Roots</h3><ul><li><p>Our brains <strong>encode beliefs</strong> through repeated emotional experiences. “Neurons that fire together, wire together.”</p></li><li><p>Beliefs—especially negative ones—become <strong>strong neural pathways</strong>. The amygdala tags negative experiences as dangerous, reinforcing fear-based beliefs.</p></li><li><p>Evaluating beliefs (true/false) activates prefrontal and emotional brain areas. Strong beliefs often provide a familiar emotional payoff—even if they’re harmful.</p></li></ul><h3>Developmental Patterns</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Before age 7</strong>, children absorb beliefs from their environment without question.</p></li><li><p>Early messages like “You’re too sensitive” or “Stop being lazy” become <em>internalized truths</em>.</p></li><li><p>Psychologist Jeffrey Young’s schema therapy identifies 18 early maladaptive schemas formed from unmet needs like safety, connection, or validation.</p></li></ul><h3>Social &amp; Cultural Influence</h3><ul><li><p>Beliefs are also <em>inherited</em> socially: from media, school, religion, and stereotypes.</p></li><li><p>Internalized racism, sexism, or classism can form beliefs like “people like me don’t belong.”</p></li><li><p>Social psychology experiments (like stereotype threat) show how even a subtle cue can make a belief self-fulfilling.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>How to Identify Limiting Beliefs</h2><p><strong>You can’t change what you can’t see.</strong></p><p>Here are ways to uncover the beliefs behind your emotional or behavioral patterns:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Automatic Thought Journals</strong>: Track moments of emotional intensity. Write the event, your reaction, and what you told yourself.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Downward Arrow Technique</strong>: Ask “What does that mean about me?” repeatedly until you hit a core assumption (e.g. “I’m worthless if I fail.”)</p></li><li><p><strong>Sentence Completion</strong>: Fill in blanks like “I am…”, “Others are…”, or “The world is…” to reveal subconscious beliefs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Behavioral Clues</strong>: Avoidance, perfectionism, people-pleasing, or chronic self-sabotage often point to unspoken limiting beliefs.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>How to Change Limiting Beliefs</h2><h3>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3><ul><li><p>Use <strong>Socratic questioning</strong> to evaluate your belief like a scientist.</p></li><li><p>Ask: “Is it true? What’s the evidence? What’s a more balanced belief?”</p></li><li><p>Example: Replace “I’m a failure” with “I’ve failed before—and learned and grown.”</p></li></ul><h3>Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)</h3><ul><li><p>Change the language and imagery of your thoughts.</p></li><li><p>Example: Replace “I can’t do this” with “I haven’t learned this <em>yet</em>.”</p></li><li><p>Try the “as-if” frame: Act as if you already believed the empowering version.</p></li></ul><h3>Mindfulness &amp; ACT</h3><ul><li><p>Notice your thoughts with distance: “I’m having the thought that I’m not good enough.”</p></li><li><p>Practice self-compassion: “This is hard—and I’m doing my best.”</p></li><li><p>Use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to act <em>despite</em> the limiting belief.</p></li></ul><h3>Coaching &amp; Action-Based Interventions</h3><ul><li><p>Set a challenge that tests the belief (e.g. speak publicly if you believe “I can’t speak”).</p></li><li><p>Use visualization: Mentally rehearse success.</p></li><li><p>Try the “And” Exercise: “I’m not confident AND I can learn with practice.”</p></li><li><p>Surround yourself with people who <em>disprove</em> your belief by example.</p></li></ul><h3>Hypnosis in Belief Change</h3><p>Hypnosis can help access the subconscious where many limiting beliefs live. In a relaxed state, hypnotherapy enables:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Regression work</strong>: to identify the first time the belief took root.</p></li><li><p><strong>Suggestion work</strong>: planting empowering beliefs like “I am capable” while the mind is most receptive.</p></li><li><p>Research shows that hypnosis, when integrated with CBT or coaching, can <strong>accelerate belief change</strong>, reduce anxiety, and increase self-confidence.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Your beliefs are not your destiny.</p><p>They are stories the mind wrote based on past pain, fear, and inherited narratives. But with awareness and practice, you can revise the script.</p><p>✅ Understand how they formed </p><p>✅ Identify the voice of the belief </p><p>✅ Try different belief-changing techniques </p><p>✅ Take small action in a new direction</p><p><strong>Beliefs can change—and when they do, so does everything else.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em><strong>With care and curiosity,</strong></em></p><p><em>Andreas</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>BONUS</h2><p><strong>THANKS FOR READING.

It’s essential to understand what VCs look for, build relevant knowledge, and stay close to the ecosystem.</p><h2>❇️ 5 Proven Ways to Stand Out</h2><p>You don’t need a Harvard MBA or a McKinsey badge. You need proof that you think and act like an investor.</p><h3>🔹Start Building a Personal Portfolio</h3><p>Start investing however you can:</p><ul><li><p>Angel Investing. </p></li><li><p>Syndicates (e.g. AngelList, Odin, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Crowdfunding platforms (e.g. Crowdcube, Dozen, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Write public investment theses &amp; “mock portfolios”.</p></li></ul><p>This proves pattern recognition, conviction, and initiative. Show you’re already acting like a VC.</p><h3>🔹Send Monthly Dealflow to VCs </h3><p>Choose partners at firms you admire and want to work with. Every month, email them <strong>1-2 startups</strong> they should meet. Keep it simple:</p><ul><li><p>A 1-liner on why the startup is interesting.</p></li><li><p>How it matches their thesis. Study their portfolio and learn their style.</p></li></ul><p>After 2 or 3 months, they’ll know your name and your judgment. They'll start replying to your messages and keep you top of mind in case they're hiring.</p><h3>🔹Help Partners Fundraise</h3><p>Most people forget this: GPs struggle with LP fundraising. If you can:</p><ul><li><p>Introduce warm LPs.</p></li><li><p>Recommend useful lists or materials for fundraising (Family Offices, Fund of Funds, etc.).</p></li></ul><p>You’ll instantly stand out.</p><h3>🔹Build a Network</h3><p>Venture is a relationship business. Attend events. DM people. Stay visible, helpful, and curious:</p><ul><li><p>Source startups.</p></li><li><p>Share insights.</p></li><li><p>Analyze trends.</p></li><li><p>Support VCs work.</p></li></ul><h3>🔹 Launch Something Yourself</h3><p>VCs love builders. It doesn’t have to be big. Build a community, launch a newsletter, help a founder. Anything that shows you know how to operate will set you apart from the others.</p><p>Action &gt; polish. Doers stand out.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://luisllorens.substack.com/p/how-to-break-into-venture-capital?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://luisllorens.substack.com/p/how-to-break-into-venture-capital?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h2>❇️ Venture Resources</h2><p><em>No fluff.

In a pick your poison race, it appears voters opted for the socialist. The Democratic establishment has only itself to blame. And if the party doesn’t heed the lesson out of New York, this local contest could presage a disastrous 2028 presidential primary.<br><br>I won’t waste much time on the winner, Zohran Mamdani. Suffice it to say, I’m not a fan of what he stands for. Not a fan of his freebie policy proposals, which smack of a grade school student council president promising ice cream and video games in the classroom. Not a fan of his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/19/nyregion/mamdani-globalize-intifada.html\">radical left, anti-Zionist worldview</a>, with which I’m well acquainted from my Soviet childhood.<br><br>And if Mamdani’s ideology were not a sufficient turnoff, I’d point to his thin resume. The mayor of New York City is responsible for the wellbeing of more people than the prime ministers of several NATO member nations. A prospective New York mayor needs more than Mamdani’s four years in the state assembly to prepare for the job. Sure, a geriatric candidacy won’t energize voters, but there’s a middle ground here—to quote a JFK campaign jingle: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DoUiNxh6_0\">“old enough to know, young enough to do.”</a><br><br>Given all of that, how <em>did</em> someone like Mamdani win? If you step outside of Manhattan and the East River shoreline, you’ll find that New York City is more purple than deep blue progressive. Many New York Democrats hew more moderate than their counterparts in other big cities. In a typical primary, a more sensible candidate would win.<br><br>Andrew Cuomo positioned himself as just that person—the normalcy candidate. The problem is that the disgraced former governor <em>wasn’t</em>. Normalcy is not having <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/26/cuomo-sexual-harassment-doj-00138140\">over a dozen sexual harassment</a> allegations to your name. It isn’t massaging <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/04/nyregion/cuomo-nursing-home-deaths.html\">coronavirus death counts</a> to burnish your reputation (although the architects of the Chernobyl coverup might be proud). Suddenly returning to politics less than half a decade after ignominiously resigning isn’t normal. A do-nothing, <a href=\"https://hellgatenyc.com/andrew-cuomo-chatgpt-housing-plan/\">ChatGPT-written</a> campaign from someone who only moved to the city full-time last year reeks of entitlement. We should not be surprised that these things turn voters off.<br><br>An extremist victory is what happens when the normalcy candidate isn’t actually normal.<br><br>There’s precedent for my conclusion. Look no further than the 2024 presidential race. Joe Biden desperately wanted to be the normalcy candidate. Yet being the president while you have <a href=\"https://www.thenextmove.org/p/bidens-bad-news-what-happens-when\">significant age-related impairments</a> <em>isn’t</em> normal. Kamala Harris, for all intents and purposes, became a stand-in for this abnormality. And voters chose Donald Trump.<br><br>Democrats had the experience of 2024 going into Tuesday’s election and still did nothing. As with last year’s presidential election, there was no coordination. No concerted effort by any power brokers to get on the phone with Cuomo and say “<em>You can run—it’s a free country—but we’re not supporting you.”</em> The party somehow failed to find an alternative in the largest city in the country, which, as my friend Bill Kristol pointed out, is <a href=\"https://x.com/BillKristol/status/1937500284588024018\">home to both House and Senate Democratic leaders</a>. (Technically, the field was wider than Cuomo and Mamdani, but the other candidates were non-entities). Every endorsement of Cuomo, from former President Bill Clinton on down, is an indictment of the establishment’s judgment.<br><br>It’s easy to see a similar scenario playing out in three years as the Democrats gear up for another presidential campaign. The establishment will coalesce around a candidate with real baggage—perhaps someone too intimately involved with the coverup around Biden’s health or Kamala Harris’s failed run. Skeptical voters will then opt for a radical leftist. It would be hard to fault them for their disillusionment, just as we can understand why so many New Yorkers didn’t want Cuomo.<br><br>Yet in choosing someone from the far-left fringe who’s unpalatable to many in the broader electorate, Democratic primary voters will risk handing the Oval Office to JD Vance or some other unscrupulous Trump disciple. Similarly, Republican mayoral hopeful Curtis Sliwa—New York’s resident Batman in a red beret, more costumed character than proper candidate—or <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-charged-bribery-and-campaign-finance-offenses\">Turkey-bribed</a> <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/post/191638/donald-trump-tom-homan-border-eric-adams-deal\">Trump hostage</a> Mayor Eric Adams could have at least a fighting chance against the radical socialist.<br><br>Never say never. Mamdani himself started at the bottom of the polls only to leapfrog a former governor in a matter of months while the Democratic establishment watched on. A political party that’s as passive as this is just one sleepwalk away from never waking up again.</p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thenextmove.org/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\"></p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email…\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div><p><em>Please consider upgrading to a paid subscription.

Flaticon</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Over the past few years, I’ve created more than a dozen digital products and generated multiple six figures in digital product sales.</p><p>I’ve created everything from e-books, 30-day challenges, digital templates, Notion databases, and online courses.</p><p>I first started doing this in the productivity space with my business, <em>Peak Productivity</em>.</p><p>Now I’m doing the same thing here at <em>Write • Build • Scale</em>, where we focus on helping creators build a thriving online business.</p><p>And while I’ve made plenty of mistakes along the way (trust me, more than I’d like to admit), I now feel confident saying that I know how to build a digital product people <em>actually want to buy.</em></p><p>So in this article, I’m sharing 10 key lessons I’ve learned from building and launching 10+ digital products.</p><p>Lessons that will help you skip the mistakes, move faster, and turn your knowledge into real revenue.</p><p>Let’s dive in.</p><h2>#1: Keep It Simple</h2><p>If you’re working on your first digital product, start small and keep it simple.</p><p>You don’t need to create the ultimate product right away. In fact, I’d strongly recommend that you don’t.</p><p>Start small instead.</p><p>What does that look like?</p><ul><li><p>Instead of a 200-page e-book, write a focused 50-page guide</p></li><li><p>Instead of a 30-day challenge, begin with a 7 or 14-day challenge</p></li><li><p>Instead of a giant signature course, create a mini-course that teaches one specific skill in under 2 hours</p></li></ul><p>When you start small, it’s less intimidating to create. You’re way more likely to actually finish (and launch) it.</p><p>So many creators get stuck in perfectionism or overwhelm because they try to do too much with their first product, and they never end up releasing it. </p><p>Don’t fall into that trap.</p><p>Also, lots of creators think that “more = more value.” But that’s not true. </p><p>Your audience is busy. They don’t want 100 videos or a 300-page book, they want results as quickly as possible. </p><p>In many cases, a short and focused product that solves a specific problem fast is way more valuable than a bloated, all-in-one program.</p><p>So if you’re building your first digital product, resist the urge to go big. Keep it small and keep it simple. </p><p>Your goal should be to launch it quickly, so you build momentum.</p><h3>#2: Offer a Clear Transformation</h3><p>One reason why many digital products flop is that the transformation isn’t clear enough.</p><p><em>You</em> might understand how valuable <em>your</em> product is. </p><p><em>You</em> know how much time, energy, and insight went into it. </p><p><strong>But that doesn’t matter if your customer can’t clearly see what’s in it for them.</strong></p><p>That means you need to answer three crucial questions:</p><ul><li><p>What problem does this product help solve?</p></li><li><p>What challenge does it help people overcome?</p></li><li><p>What result or outcome does it help them achieve?</p></li></ul><p>This is what makes your product valuable. </p><p>Not how long it is, not how many lessons or downloads it includes. It’s about the change it creates in someone’s life or business.</p><p>Remember, people don’t buy digital products for the <em>information</em>. They buy them for the <em>transformation</em>.</p><p>Give them a transformation worth paying for.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>#3: Validate Before You Build</h3><p>Here’s a painful lesson I had to learn the hard way: Just because <em>you</em> think your digital product idea is amazing doesn’t mean other people do.</p><p>One of the biggest mistakes I see new creators make is jumping straight into building mode without first checking if anyone even wants what they’re building. </p><p>And that’s how people end up spending <em>weeks</em> creating a product… only for it to flop on launch day.</p><p>So before you build anything, validate that there’s actual demand. How you validate demand depends on whether or not you already have an audience.</p><h4>If You Don’t Have an Audience Yet:</h4><p>Your best strategy is to do market research. Look around and see if your idea already exists, and if it’s already selling.</p><p>If other creators have been selling the same ebook, course, or template for a year - and still promote it - that likely means it’s <em>profitable</em>. </p><p>People are buying it. There’s demand. That’s your green light.</p><p>Now you might be wondering:</p><blockquote><p>“How can I compete with them if the product already exists?”</p></blockquote><p>Well, even if your product idea isn’t 100% unique, your approach, your teaching style, your story, your beliefs, and your way of explaining things might be.</p><p>People will buy your product when they trust you and feel connected with you, even if the same exact product is already created by someone else.</p><h4>If You Do Have an Audience:</h4><p>If you already have an online audience, validating demand becomes easier.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Build a waitlist: </strong>Create a quick landing page describing your idea and invite your audience to join the waitlist to get an early-bird discount when it’s released. If you get a lot of sign-ups, it’s a strong signal of interest. If barely anyone signs up, that’s also valuable feedback.</p></li><li><p><strong>Run a pre-order campaign: </strong>Create a basic sales page <em>before</em> building your product. You explain the concept, promise a launch date (say, 30 days from now), and offer a big discount or bonus for people who buy now. If you get enough sales: great, the idea is validated.</p></li></ul><p>All in all, always validate your product idea.</p><p>Don’t confuse personal excitement for market demand. Just because <em>you</em> think it’s a brilliant idea doesn’t automatically mean people will pay for it.</p><p>Validate first. It could save you <em>a lot</em> of time, energy, and frustration.</p><h3>#4: Use The Right Tools</h3><p>The right tools and software can help you build your digital product faster, easier, and make it more profitable. </p><p>Here are the exact tools I use to build, sell, and automate my digital products:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Loom</strong> – I use this to record video lessons for my online courses. Super quick and easy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Canva</strong> – This is where I create slides for my videos and design workbooks, checklists, and templates. No design background needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>LeadPages</strong> – My go-to tool for building high-converting sales pages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thinkific</strong> – I use this to host all of my courses and digital products. It also handles payments and gives buyers instant access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kit (previously ConvertKit)</strong> – This is where I set up automated email funnels that sell my products on autopilot.</p></li><li><p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> – From outlining digital products to writing scripts, brainstorming, writing sales copy, and even creating bonus resources, ChatGPT speeds up everything and takes a lot of the mental friction away.</p></li></ul><p>Now, if you’re just getting started and want a low-cost option that does <em>almost</em> everything in one place, check out Gumroad.</p><p>It’s beginner-friendly, free to get started, and it handles sales pages, payment processing, and hosting for your digital products or courses. </p><p>They just take a small cut of each sale, which is perfect when you're new and not ready to pay $99/month for every tool under the sun.</p><h3>#5: Learn Copywriting</h3><p>Copywriting is one of the most important skills for any digital creator. </p><p>You can have the best course, the most helpful e-book, or the most valuable set of templates out there, but if you can’t communicate the value of it <strong>clearly</strong> and <strong>persuasively</strong>, nobody’s going to buy it.</p><p>Without copywriting, you won’t be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Write a sales page that actually converts</p></li><li><p>Write marketing emails that build excitement and drive sales</p></li><li><p>Describe your product in a way that makes people say, “I need this”</p></li></ul><p>One of the most valuable copywriting lessons I learned is to focus more on the <strong>benefits</strong> of your offer, and not so much on the <strong>features</strong> of your offer.</p><p>But most product creators do the reverse. </p><p>They’ll say things like:</p><ul><li><p>This course includes 17 lessons and 5 hours of video</p></li><li><p>This e-book is 187 pages long</p></li><li><p>This product took me 3 months to create</p></li></ul><p>That’s good to mention once, but it’s not what people <em>really</em> care about. If most of your marketing message is on the features, you’re not going to sell much.</p><p>Instead, people care about:</p><ul><li><p>Will this help me solve the problem I’m struggling with?</p></li><li><p>Will this help me get the result I want faster or easier?</p></li><li><p>Will this give me the transformation I’ve been chasing?</p></li></ul><p>That’s the <em>real</em> value. And that’s what your copy needs to highlight—on your sales page, in your marketing emails, in your social posts. Everywhere.</p><p>So if you’re serious about making money online, take the time to learn the basics of copywriting.</p><p>You don’t need to be a master. But you <em>do</em> need to know how to talk about your product in a way that makes people want to buy.</p><p>Because if your copy doesn’t spark interest, it doesn’t matter how great your product is. No interest = no sales.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>#6: Different Format = Different Price Point</h3><p>You can teach the same thing, solve the same problem, and offer the same transformation, but the format you choose for your digital product will drastically change how much you can charge for it.</p><p>Say you package your knowledge into an e-book. Unless you’re incredibly famous or your book has gone viral, you’re going to have a hard time selling it for more than $20.</p><p>(And even $20 is on the high end for most e-books.)</p><p>Now take that <em>same</em> content, but package it into a mini-course—with videos, slides, maybe a workbook—and suddenly, you can price it at $50, $75, even $100+.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because the perceived value of an online course is much higher than an e-book, even if the <em>actual content</em> is pretty much the same.</p><p>And this applies to other formats too:</p><ul><li><p>A 30-day challenge might sell for $27–$47</p></li><li><p>A toolkit or template bundle could go for $19–$49</p></li><li><p>A cohort-based program might sell for $300–$1,000+</p></li></ul><p>Same core content. Different format. Way different pricing.</p><p>That’s why for my productivity business, I focused almost exclusively on creating online mini-courses.</p><p>I knew I could charge $97 for something that might only be worth $15 as an e-book.</p><p>Same outcome. Same content. Just a more profitable delivery format.</p><p>Now, I’m not saying you <em>shouldn’t</em> create e-books. If that’s your preferred style, go for it. </p><p>But just know: your format determines your price point. And your price point determines your profitability.</p><h3>#7: Have Upsells Available</h3><p>It’s way easier to sell to an existing customer than to find a new one. In fact, studies show that someone who’s already bought from you is<strong> 76% more likely </strong>to buy again.</p><p>That’s why every time you sell a digital product, whether it’s a $49 mini-course or a $19 template, you should have an upsell ready.</p><p>Say someone buys your online course. Awesome.</p><p>But what if, on the checkout page, you offered a relevant add-on (like a bundle of templates, a toolkit, or a workbook) for $15 or $25?</p><p>That’s called an order bump, and it works like magic. It’s a no-brainer, impulse-buy that increases your average order value with almost zero extra effort.</p><p>Then, after the sale, either in the confirmation email or a follow-up email sequence, you can introduce a higher-ticket upsell.</p><p>This could be:</p><ul><li><p>A 1-on-1 coaching call</p></li><li><p>A more in-depth digital product</p></li><li><p>A VIP experience or group consulting package</p></li></ul><p>The idea is simple: <strong>don’t stop at one sale.</strong></p><p>If you’ve already earned someone’s trust and they’ve paid you once, why not offer them something else that provides additional value to them?</p><p>So when you’re creating your digital products, ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p>What’s a low-ticket add-on I can offer as an order bump?</p></li><li><p>What’s a premium offer I can make on the back end?</p></li></ul><p>More value for them. More revenue for you. </p><p>Win-win.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>#8: Build a Simple Sales Funnel</h3><p>A sales funnel might sound complicated and intimidating, but it’s not.</p><p>All a sales funnel really is, is a system that helps people go from discovering you to buying your digital product.</p><p>Let me break down a few simple ways to do this.</p><h4>The Content Funnel:</h4><p>This is the easiest funnel to set up.</p><p>You just link to your digital product inside your content, whether that’s a Substack post, a newsletter, or a blog article.</p><p>This works great for low-ticket products (think $7 – $97). Something that people can buy impulsively without much hesitation.</p><p>So, if you’re writing a post about productivity, and you have a mini-course on deep work or time-blocking, simply drop a link to that course somewhere in the post.</p><p>Do this often enough (without spamming the link, but placing it strategically), and you’ll make sales.</p><h4>The Email Funnel:</h4><p>This one takes a bit more time to set up, but it can generate sales for you on autopilot.</p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><ol><li><p>In your content, promote a freebie (like a helpful PDF guide, an email course, or a checklist)</p></li><li><p>People sign up with their email address to get it</p></li><li><p>Then you add them to an automated email sequence (via Kit, for example)</p></li><li><p>A few emails into that email sequence, you introduce your digital product</p></li></ol><p>This system works especially well for mid-tier products ($97 - $497), where people need a little more warming up before they’re ready to buy.</p><p>The beauty of this is that once you’ve set it up, it runs on autopilot in the background.</p><p>You can simply focus on creating content and building your audience, while your email funnel turns new readers into paying customers without your active involvement.</p><h3>#9: Collect and Leverage Testimonials</h3><p>You saying your digital product is awesome is one thing. But when other people say your product is awesome, that’s when trust skyrockets (and sales follow).</p><p>Think about your own buying behavior. When you're on Amazon or booking an Airbnb, what’s one of the first things you check? </p><p>The reviews.</p><p>Well, your potential customers do the same thing.</p><p>They want to hear from real people who bought your product, used it, and got positive results.</p><p>That’s why collecting and sharing testimonials is one of the smartest things you can do to increase your conversions.</p><p>Whenever someone buys your digital product, follow up:</p><ul><li><p>Send them a quick email or DM after a few days</p></li><li><p>Ask them how they’re enjoying the product</p></li><li><p>Ask if they’d be open to sharing a few lines about what they liked or what result they got</p></li></ul><p>You’d be surprised how many people are happy to share something when you just ask.</p><p>Once you’ve got those testimonials, use them:</p><ul><li><p>Add them to your sales page</p></li><li><p>Share them in your marketing emails</p></li><li><p>Sprinkle them in your content (the occasional Substack Note, for example)</p></li></ul><p>Testimonials build trust. And trust converts.</p><h3>#10: Improve Your Digital Product As You Go</h3><p>Your digital product doesn’t have to be “perfect” when you launch it.</p><p>In fact, it won’t be. And that’s totally okay.</p><p>Perfection is the enemy of progress. If you wait until every module, every design, every sentence is “perfect,” you’ll never hit publish.</p><p>What really matters is that it helps your customer go from A to B. When that’s the case, launch it.</p><p>Once you’ve made your first sales, you’ll start getting real feedback from real customers.</p><p>They’ll tell you:</p><ul><li><p>What they loved the most</p></li><li><p>What confused them</p></li><li><p>What’s missing</p></li><li><p>What could make it even more useful</p></li></ul><p>That feedback is gold.</p><p>Use it to upgrade your product. Improve your examples. Add bonus lessons. Re-record a video or two. Polish the workbook. Tweak the onboarding process.</p><p>Version 2.0 and 3.0 of your product will be way more impactful, simply because you’ve built it around what your customers <em>actually want</em>.</p><p>And the better your product becomes, the more confident <em>you</em> get in selling it.</p><p>When you know your product delivers, you’ll feel more comfortable promoting it, raising the price, running a launch, adding it to your funnel, etc.</p><p>So don’t fall into the perfection trap.</p><p>Just launch. Get it out there. Improve it as you go.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>"

Meta also considered acquiring Ilya Sutskever’s SSI (last valued at $32B), Perplexity (last valued at $14B), and is offering 9-figure pay packages for AI researchers to join Meta’s superintelligence team (total spend could be up to $5B).</p><p>So, Meta was prepared to spend <s>at least $30B</s>, err let me rephrase, <em>whatever it takes</em> to be competitive at the leading edge of AI.</p><p>This is apparently in response to the underperformance of Meta’s model developments, from <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Stratechery</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The proximate cause for this reevaluation is the apparent five alarm fire that is happening at Meta: the company’s latest Llama 4 release was disappointing — and in at least one case, deceptive — pushing founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to go on a major spending spree for talent.</em></p></blockquote><p>This will not be an analysis of whether or not these investments will work, but rather why they’re making these investments. Similar to my arguments on big tech’s CapEx investments, this is all logical. In summary, Meta has:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Personal motivations:</strong> Meta’s history of conflict with the platform they sit on top of (Apple) has led to a “do anything necessary” mentality to own the next big platform.</p></li><li><p><strong>Profitable applications of AI:</strong> Meta has one of the most profitable applications of AI in the world (advertising systems) to justify ROI on these investments.</p></li><li><p><strong>An unsatisfactory rate of progress:</strong> Meta’s not making the progress Zuck wants to in AI. Of the three largest paths towards model improvements (compute, data, and talent/algorithms), talent is the most differentiated today.</p></li><li><p><strong>Incentives + no reasonable alternative:</strong> Meta has the applications to profit from AI (carrot) + a risk of relying on someone else for the next big platform shift (stick) + no reasonable investment alternative ($20B in profit last quarter!) = play the AI arms race.</p></li></ol><p>If we squint, we can see the big vision for AI take form: a personal assistant at our fingertips, with context on our lives, that gets better as it becomes more powerful and more personalized. As it gets more integrated into our lives, it gets harder to replace.</p><p>The window to become that personal assistant is closing. This is the prize Meta is chasing, and the risk of underinvesting towards that vision is far greater than the risk of overinvesting.</p><p>This will be a rundown of Meta’s AI strategy, their motivations from past scars, the current state of their tech, and their vision for the future.</p><h2>I. Some Historical Context</h2><p>Three pieces of important historical context to understand Meta’s motivations:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Meta initially viewed themselves, and has always had the aspirations to be, a platform company.</strong></p></li></ol><p>This started with the Facebook platform in the early 2010s, enabling companies to build apps on top of Facebook’s ecosystem (you guys remember Farmville?). In the early days, the platform was just as important as advertising in the eyes of Zuck and the team.</p><p>However, as mobile took off, it became clear Facebook was a mobile <em><strong>application</strong></em>, but the mobile <em><strong>platform</strong></em> would be Apple’s. And that fact has caused Zuck as much stress as any other:</p><blockquote><p><em>\"There are all these things that, over time, Google—but especially Apple—have prevented us from doing, even though I think they would be good for consumers. At some point, we ran the numbers and realized that if we were able to do all the things we thought were beneficial—considering the additional engagement, increased app usage, and avoiding various fees—I think we might be twice as profitable as a company as we are now.\"</em> - Zuck in a Stripe Sessions Interview (lightly edited for clarity)</p></blockquote><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>To avoid that pain again, Meta made two opinionated bets on the platforms of the future in the early 2010s: AR/VR and AI.</strong></p></li></ol><p>For AR/VR, Meta acquired Oculus for $2B in 2014. As has been well-documented, they’ve spent well over $60 billion in pursuit of owning that platform.</p><p>For AI, they hired Yann LeCun in 2013, as well as other top AI researchers, and developed a near duopoly on top AI talent with Google. FAIR (now Meta AI) became one of the most respected AI research labs in the world.</p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Meta created one of the most profitable applications of AI of any company in the world.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Meta has profitably spent tens (perhaps hundreds) of billions of dollars on GPUs. Digital advertising is one of the most profitable businesses in history, and there are only three ways to increase revenue: increase users, increase screen time, or increase the likelihood that an ad converts to a purchase.</p><p>Meta’s recommendation systems are the best way to capitalize on the third variable, taking all the data they have and personalizing ads based on that data.

Creating “The Ultimate Business Results Machine”</strong></p><p>Meta’s advertising engine has become so good that they know business’ customers far better than they do in most cases. This advertising black box is the clearest path to AI ROI for Meta.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-about-ai-and-the-evolution-of-social-media/\">Stratechery interview</a>, Zuck described what this system would look like:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Improve recommendations, make it so that any business that basically wants to achieve some business outcome can just come to us, not have to produce any content, not have to know anything about their customers. Can just say, “Here’s the business outcome that I want, here’s what I’m willing to pay, I’m going to connect you to my bank account, I will pay you for as many business outcomes as you can achieve.” </em>(lightly edited for clarity)</p></blockquote><p><strong>2.

Well, the third epoch is I think that there’s going to be all this AI-generated content and you’re not going to lose the others, you’re still going to have all the creator content, you’re still going to have some of the friend content.” </em>(lightly edited for clarity)</p></blockquote><p>However, as referenced earlier, the big vision Zuck’s fighting for with these AI investments is a personalized and ever-present AI. Again, the ROI is increased engagement on the platform, leading to more advertising dollars.</p><p><strong>3. The General Purpose AI Assistant</strong></p><p>This is the biggest prize on the AI field right now. Viewed through this lens, OpenAI’s Jony Ive acquisition makes sense. The importance of memory becomes clear. The future is a world where you have your assistant with you at all times, and whoever owns this, has pole position on being <em>the AI company</em>. It’s what OpenAI, Meta, and Google are fighting for.</p><blockquote><p><em>\"There are two primary values we're aiming to deliver. On the AR and mixed reality side, our main goal is to create a strong sense of presence. The other major focus is personalized AI, which is where Llama, Meta AI, and related efforts come in. There's a lot of ongoing development to make these models increasingly intelligent, but I think things will become truly compelling when the AI is personalized specifically for you.\" - </em>Zuck on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI\">Huge if True</a> (lightly edited for clarity)</p></blockquote><p>Meta’s got user data, the lead in AR/VR/AI glasses, and they’ve got a model that could be in the race for the leading edge. They’re well-positioned to compete for this prize, and it’s the one that’s got to be top of mind for Meta when making these investments.</p><h2>IV. How do they achieve that vision (hint: people still matter)?</h2><p>We’ve now come full circle. Meta and Zuck have the personal scars, the financial motivation, and the vision for their AI future. But how do they get there?</p><p>There are three primary vectors of improvement for AI: compute (GPUs/data centers/energy), data, and algorithms (as a proxy for human talent). The compute bottleneck has eased, and Meta’s over-acquired GPUs compared to rivals since 2023.</p><p>With the Scale investment and all the talent investments referenced above, they’re making a bet on data and on talent. But mostly on talent.</p><p>For all the talk of AI automating human labor, AI advancement is being driven by humans.</p><p>Steve Jobs told us to <em>“Never forget the dynamic range of humans.”</em> Well, Zuck isn’t. And it’s his best shot at achieving his vision and avoiding the same platform pains that have played out over the last decade.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.generativevalue.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading Generative Value!

Ask Vice President Vance: “We had an incredibly targeted, precise surgical strike on the nuclear facilities that are the target of the American operation,” he declared on Sunday. It was, <strong><a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5362860-vance-no-interest-in-boots-on-the-ground-in-iran/\">he later added</a></strong> “a very precise, a very surgical strike tailored to an American national interest. And that national interest is Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”</p><p>Americans, and especially Republicans, have long relished the term <em>surgical strike</em>, and it’s easy to understand why. Standards of surgery are exceptionally high in the United States, just as tolerance of military casualties is relatively low. The notion is therefore alluring that one can resolve an international problem—especially an intractable one such as Iran’s long-standing ambition to acquire nuclear weapons—with a single, swift, surgical procedure.</p><p>Ironically, as Richard Nixon’s former speechwriter <strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/04/magazine/on-language-on-surgical-strike.html\">William Safire</a></strong> pointed out nearly 40 years ago, the term <em>surgical strike</em> originated as left-wing satire. The first use of the phrase, according to Safire, was in an article by Richard Barnet in <em>Harper’s</em> <em>Magazine</em> in November 1971. “Even [in] the language of the bureaucracy,” Barnet wrote, “the ‘surgical strike’ for chasing and mowing down peasants from the air by spraying them with 8,000 bullets a minute—takes the mystery, awe, and pain out of violence.”</p><p>There was nothing surgical about the American use of air power in Vietnam. According to the diary of Nixon’s chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, Henry Kissinger also used the phrase at around that time, though the surgical strike he had in mind was a possible Soviet attack on Chinese nuclear facilities.</p><p>Only with the advent and rapid development of precision weaponry such as guided missiles in the 1980s did the term lose its pejorative connotation. By the time Safire was writing—just after Ronald Reagan’s administration had struck Libyan targets in retaliation for the <strong><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/event/West-Berlin-discotheque-bombing-1986\">West Berlin discotheque bombing</a></strong> of April 1986—<em>surgical strike</em> had taken on the modern meaning used by Vice President Vance on Sunday. As with the revival of the slogan “peace through strength,” this is one of those conscious echoes of Reaganism that befuddle those who would misrepresent the second Trump administration as isolationist.</p><p>Last week, when I was explaining why I expected Trump to strike the Fordow fuel enrichment plant, I pointed out that, despite frivolous jokes about the TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) trade, Trump Enjoys Surgical Strikes (TESS). We saw that three times in his first term: in April 2017, when he dropped the “<strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39595989\">Mother of All Bombs</a></strong>” on Afghanistan; a year later, when he ordered missile strikes on Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime; and in January 2020, when he <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50979463\">authorized the assassination</a></strong> of commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Qasem Soleimani. The relish with which Trump announced the strikes against Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan on Saturday night was characteristic. “A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow,” <strong><a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114724035571020048\">he enthused</a></strong>. “All planes are safely on their way home. . . . NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”</p><p></p><p><em>To read the rest of this article, go to: </em></p><div class=\"embedded-post-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;id&quot;:166671701,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.thefp.com/p/niall-ferguson-what-comes-after-trump-surgical-strikes-iran&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:260347,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;The Free Press&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XTc7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cb7f208-a15c-46a8-a040-7e7a2150def9_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Niall Ferguson: What Comes After Trump’s ‘Surgical Strikes’?&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;What to make of Saturday’s “surgical strikes” on Iranian nuclear installations?

data-component-name=\"MentionToDOM\"></span> is the Positive Echo’s Featured Guest. For a change I’m going to say little about this amazing post. I love deep thinking but my head’s been spinning this last week after reading this. Now I just need to get myself out of Ana’s way!</p><p>The floor is yours Ana</p><div><hr></div><p>In a world that moves fast, where the loudest voice often wins and virtue feels like an old-fashioned word, we are choosing a different way.</p><p>We are choosing the slow, small, stubborn work of raising souls in goodness.</p><p>Not by accident.</p><p>Not by crossing our fingers and hoping.</p><p>But by planting seeds, day after day after day, <em>on purpose</em>.</p><h2><strong>What Virtue Looks Like in a House Full of Children</strong></h2><p>It doesn’t look polished or scripted. It looks like tying the same shoelaces five times while someone cries over a broken banana.</p><p>It looks like a toddler offering the last cracker to her baby sister, even though she really wanted it herself. It looks like a whispered confession over spilled paint, a shaky hand reaching for courage on the first day of a new class.</p><p>In our home, virtue isn’t a framed list on the wall.</p><p>It’s a lived thing… sticky, messy, tender, real.</p><p>It shows up between breakfast and bedtime, between squabbles and snuggles, between tiny moments we could easily miss if we weren’t paying attention.</p><p>Virtue grows in the interruptions, in the second chances, in the ways we choose to love, again and again, even when it’s hard.</p><p><em><strong>But Virtue Doesn’t Grow by Itself</strong></em></p><p>It needs soil.</p><p>It needs tending.</p><p>It needs intention.</p><p>If we want to raise children who are kind, courageous, patient, and good, we have to give them more than rules.</p><p>We have to give them<em> practice.</em></p><p>Here’s how we are trying to do that, imperfectly, but faithfully in our home.</p><h2><strong>A Family Plan for Practicing Virtue</strong></h2><h4><strong>Build It Into the Week (One Virtue at a Time)</strong></h4><p>Every week, we gather the kids and we name the virtue we’ll practice in the next seven days,</p><p>One virtue. One focus. One small way to live it out. We rotate through them slowly, like a garden rotating crops.</p><p>Here’s where we begin:</p><ul><li><p>Kindness</p><ul><li><p>Make a sibling’s bed.</p></li><li><p>Share a favorite toy or treat.</p></li><li><p>Write a kind note or draw a picture for someone.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Courage</p><ul><li><p>Try something you’ve been afraid to do (like speaking up, jumping into the pool, telling the truth).</p></li><li><p>Stand up for someone being left out.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Gratitude</p><ul><li><p>Write a thank-you letter to someone who helps you.</p></li><li><p>Say five things you’re thankful for at dinner.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Patience</p><ul><li><p>Let someone else go first without complaining.</p></li><li><p>Wait quietly in line, at home, or at the store.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Honesty</p><ul><li><p>Tell the truth about small things, even when it’s tempting not to.</p></li><li><p>Reflect on why honesty builds trust.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Forgiveness</p><ul><li><p>Practice saying “I forgive you” without keeping score.</p></li><li><p>Pray for someone you’re upset with.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Generosity</p><ul><li><p>Donate a toy, a book, or your time to someone in need.</p></li><li><p>Share something you really love.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>We don’t wait for opportunities to pop up, we create them, we let virtue be practiced on purpose.</p><h2><strong>Make Space for Reflection (Once a Week, Slowly)</strong></h2><p>Virtue grows quietly.</p><p>It often grows so slowly we can miss it, unless we stop, once in a while, to notice.</p><p>In our home, we choose one day a week, sometimes at dinner, sometimes at bedtime, sometimes on a long drive, to pause and reflect together.</p><p>Not every day or every moment, just once a week, intentionally, without rush.</p><p>We ask simple, open-hearted questions:</p><ul><li><p>What was the kindest thing you did this week?</p></li><li><p>Was there a time you were brave, even if it was just a little?</p></li><li><p>When was it hardest to be patient, and what helped you?</p></li><li><p>Was it difficult to tell the truth? How did it feel afterward?</p></li><li><p>Did you have a moment where you forgave someone, or needed forgiveness?</p></li></ul><p>Sometimes the answers are long stories, or a shrug and a smile. Sometimes they are silence, and that’s okay too.</p><p>The goal isn’t to fill the air with words, but is to make reflection feel normal, good, and safe.</p><p>Over time, children learn to look back and name the places where virtue bloomed. They begin to see that their small efforts mattered. They begin to see that goodness is growing in them, even when they don’t notice it.</p><p>And so do we.</p><h2><strong>Practice, Not Preach</strong></h2><p>When children make mistakes (and they will) we don’t shame them.<br>Instead, we walk through it with them, gently helping them find their way back.<br>We say, “Let’s try again,” offering them a new chance without judgment.</p><p>When they do something beautiful, we name it out loud so they can see it too.<br>We might say, “I saw how you waited without complaining. That was real patience,” or, “I noticed you told the truth even though it was hard. That was real courage.”<br>We make virtue visible, calling it by its name.</p><p>And when we see it, we celebrate it like a true victory, <em>because it is.</em></p><p>We are not chasing perfection.<br>We are not performing for the world.<br>We are simply practicing, slowly and steadily, the art of becoming who they are meant to be.</p><h2><strong>Fill Their Imaginations with Stories of Virtue</strong></h2><p>Children live in the stories we tell them.</p><p>If we want to raise kids in virtue, we need to fill their hearts with stories where goodness is brave, kindness matters, and truth wins.</p><p>Here are examples of children’s books paired with virtues:</p><p><strong>Kindness</strong></p><ul><li><p>“The Very Cranky Bear” by Nick Bland<br>A funny and beautiful story about friends thinking of someone else’s needs and showing kindness even when it’s not easy.</p></li><li><p>“Have You Filled a Bucket Today?” by Carol McCloud<br>A simple but profound way to teach kindness through the image of “bucket filling”, small acts that brighten someone’s day.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Courage</strong></p><ul><li><p>“The Lion Inside” by Rachel Bright<br>A timid little mouse finds the courage to speak up, a story about bravery coming from unexpected places.</p></li><li><p>“Brave Irene” by William Steig<br>Irene fights through a storm to deliver a package for her sick mother, perseverance and courage at its best.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Gratitude</strong></p><ul><li><p>“The Thankful Book” by Todd Parr<br>Colorful and simple, reminding even little ones how much there is to be thankful for, every day.</p></li><li><p>“Bear Says Thanks” by Karma Wilson<br>Bear wants to throw a feast but doesn’t have much to offer; his friends remind him that gratitude and presence are enough.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Patience</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Waiting” by Kevin Henkes<br>A gentle, beautiful book about waiting and watching life unfold with wonder and patience.</p></li><li><p>“Llama Llama Mad at Mama” by Anna Dewdney<br>Llama Llama shows impatience, and learns (eventually) to manage big feelings while waiting.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Honesty</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Sam Tells Stories” by Thierry Robberecht<br>Sam loves to tell tall tales, but learns why honesty matters to true friendship.</p></li><li><p>“Ruthie and the (Not So) Teeny Tiny Lie” by Laura Rankin<br>A little girl tells a lie and faces the hard truth about how lies affect relationships.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Forgiveness</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Enemy Pie” by Derek Munson<br>A clever, heartfelt story about learning to forgive and even befriend someone you thought was an “enemy.”</p></li><li><p>“The Berenstain Bears and the Forgiving Tree” by Jan and Mike Berenstain<br>Brother Bear learns an important lesson about forgiveness after a hurtful mistake.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Generosity</strong></p><ul><li><p>“The Giving Tree” by Shel Silverstein<br>A timeless, bittersweet tale of unconditional giving.</p></li><li><p>“Those Shoes” by Maribeth Boelts<br>A beautiful story about giving up something you want for someone who needs it more.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Empathy</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Last Stop on Market Street” by Matt de la Peña<br>A boy and his grandmother see beauty and need all around them during their bus ride, learning to notice others with empathy and gratitude.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Humility</strong></p><ul><li><p>“The Pout-Pout Fish” by Deborah Diesen<br>Pout-Pout Fish learns that sometimes it’s not about you, it’s about seeing and loving others.</p></li><li><p>“The Paper Bag Princess” by Robert Munsch<br>Princess Elizabeth shows resilience, humility, and strength after losing everything.</p></li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><h2><strong>Live It Yourself (Especially in the Quiet Moments)</strong></h2><p>Children are always watching us with wonder.</p><p>Not to find us perfect, but to understand what goodness looks like when it’s lived. They learn virtue not from lectures, but from the way we move through ordinary days:</p><ul><li><p>The patience we show when plans fall apart.</p></li><li><p>The kindness we offer when no one is looking.</p></li><li><p>The courage to admit when we are wrong.</p></li><li><p>The gratitude we whisper at the end of a hard day.</p></li><li><p>The forgiveness we extend before an apology is even spoken.</p></li></ul><p>When we live virtue, not perfectly, but faithfully, something deep and unseen begins to take root in them.</p><p>They are not memorizing our words, they are absorbing our lives. And when we stumble, and we will stumble, they are not wounded by our weakness if we meet it with humility.</p><p>They see that virtue isn’t about being flawless, it’s about beginning again, and again, and again. You do not have to model perfection.</p><p>You only have to model perseverance in goodness.</p><p>In the end, your ordinary acts of patience, honesty, forgiveness, and love will be the soil their souls grow in.</p><p>The life you live before them will become part of the life they live long after they leave your arms.</p><p>Raising kids in virtue isn’t a project to complete; it’s a pilgrimage we walk day by day, often slowly, often sacredly, and most often unseen by the world.</p><p>It is the work that will outlast every other thing we build or achieve, the quiet, steady labor that shapes souls for eternity.</p><p>Every act of kindness we plant, every choice of courage we water, every forgiveness we offer like a seed into the soil of their hearts, all of it matters.</p><p>One day, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, we will see it: the quiet garden we tended, blooming silently and beautifully inside them, and we will know it was worth it, every minute spent, every mess endured, every small, faltering beginning.</p><p>You are not just raising good kids; you are raising<em> souls.</em></p><p>So keep planting. Keep practicing. Keep walking the slow, beautiful road of raising them well.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Please leave your comment</h2><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://garycoulton.substack.com/p/featured-guest-ana-harrison-raising/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://garycoulton.substack.com/p/featured-guest-ana-harrison-raising/comments\"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Connect with Ana at <span class=\"mention-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ana Harrison&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:136415725,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c166f7d-d19d-48ba-8e4d-1df2e8beb13b_539x538.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;7c4e5dcf-0e10-4c58-854d-4f5608fa68bc&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"MentionToDOM\"></span> </h2><p>Where you can read more of her great posts and consider subscribing to her Substack.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://substack.com/@anaharrison&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe to Ana's Substack&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://substack.com/@anaharrison\"><span>Subscribe to Ana's Substack</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h2>Subscribe to “The Positive Echo”</h2><p>If you are new here please also consider taking up a FREE subscription.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://garycoulton.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">The Positive Echo is a reader-supported publication.
