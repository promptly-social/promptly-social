Maybe not the first time <em>posting became policy</em>, but it’s hard to find a clearer example. I was in the middle of the grocery store grabbing bananas when I got the notification, which just underscored how strange and disorienting this all is. </p><div

href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-25/new-yorkers-withstand-scorching-heat-to-choose-mayoral-candidate?srnd=homepage-americas\">Zohran Mamdani won the NYC Democratic Mayoral Primary</a>, a highly contested race that he ran with sheer narrative discipline and command of the digital. Even if you don’t like his policies (I think many of them are unworkable) the campaign was good! He walked the entire length of Manhattan. He was everywhere, all the time.</p><p>And finally, a few days before both of those, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-21/andreessen-horowitz-backs-ai-startup-with-slogan-cheat-at-everything\">a startup called Cluely<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> </a>raised a $15 million round led by a16z<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a>. The company’s modus operandi is <a href=\"https://x.com/FT/status/1937518626484912447\">‘cheat on everything’. </a>Like sure, of course. But a16z didn’t invest based on that! They invested based on Cluely’s attention capture capability! Cluely is good at getting people to pay attention to them and is largely copying the enterprise Jake Paul playbook (stunts, virality, nihilism, and a vibe-first narrative) for B2C AI apps. We’ve already seen “brain-rot marketing” take over culture so it was only a matter of time before it hit the startup world.</p><p>But these three things  - geopolitical conflict, a mayoral primary, a startup raise - are indicators of something I want to tie a thread through in this piece:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Attention is infrastructure</strong>: Determines what gets funded, elected, or build</p></li><li><p><strong>Narrative is capital</strong>: It drives flows of money, policy, and sentiment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Speculation</strong> is the <strong>operating layer</strong> between the two - it’s how belief is tested, priced, and converted into outcomes <em>before</em> institutions act.</p></li></ul><p>What we’re seeing isn’t just a media trend. It’s a shift in the architecture of power. Attention → Speculation → Allocation. This is the new supply chain.</p><p>Traditional economic theory assumes information flows serve resource allocation. But increasingly, resource allocation serves attention flows. We've moved from an economy where attention supports other forms of value creation to one where attention <em>is</em> the value creation. </p><h4>How to Think About Attention</h4><p>Traditional economic substrates are land, labor, capital - bedrock inputs to make stuff. But now, the foundational input is attention. </p><p>Trump said he was going to take 2 weeks or so to think it through the Iran bombings… and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/us/politics/trump-truth-social-iran-war.html\">then just did it?</a> The NYT later reported that the decision to strike was influenced in part by how the Israeli campaign was<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/trump-iran-decision-strikes.html\"> “playing” on Fox News</a>, so Trump’s response very much felt like a reactive spectacle<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> rather than military strategy. And it played like theater!</p><ul><li><p>Iran knew Trump might do something because of his<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/trump-iran-decision-strikes.html\"> incessant posts.</a></p></li><li><p>Military officials feared that Trump’s posts were compromising operational secrecy, so they ordered a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/22/politics/maga-movement-divided-trump-iran\">diversionary B-2 flight to distract from the real mission. </a></p></li><li><p>Iran simply moved their uranium to a different spot, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/us/politics/iran-uranium-stockpile-whereabouts.html\">and now we don’t seem to know where it is. </a></p></li><li><p>It seems like the bombs<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/22/nx-s1-5441734/satellites-show-damage-iran-nuclear-program-not-destroyed-experts-say\"> didn’t really hit what they were supposed to?</a></p></li><li><p>Iran retaliated a few days later by<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/iran-missile-strike-on-qatar-base-fits-de-escalation-playbook?taid=6859a79c8217380001324705&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\"> striking US Gulf bases </a>signaling to the US ahead of time that the bases would be hit (I was also in the grocery store when I found out about this one)</p></li><li><p>The fact that they didn’t close down the Strait of Hormuz is a sign that things might (?) be petering out from here (I write tentatively on the morning of June 25). </p></li><li><p>Trump called for a ceasefire, a<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/24/world/ceasefire-iran-israel-trump\">nd both Israel and Iran seem to be ignoring him</a></p></li><li><p>He said China can continue buying Iranian oil, apparently<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/trump-eases-pressure-on-iran-by-saying-china-can-buy-its-oil\"> lifting the sanctions?</a></p></li><li><p>He got <a href=\"https://x.com/cspan/status/1937468807536169315\">very mad</a> (understandably) on Live TV </p></li></ul><p>Trump only notified <em>Republican</em> members of Congress about the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/lawmakers-both-parties-question-legality-trumps-iran-strikes-rcna214316\">strikes</a>, which isn’t great. It also seems that intelligence briefings said that Iran <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-nuclear-facilities-cia\">wasn’t</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/trump-israel-iran-nuclear-facilities-cia\"> actively weaponizing its nuclear program</a> (making the bombing illegal). But, when Congress is as useful as a fish flopping next to a giant body of water, the law matters less than content strategy. </p><p>Trump yet again inverted system architecture - flipping how information and decision-making traditionally flow. Military strategy and diplomacy all became subordinate to social media dynamics. But he is moving on as <a href=\"https://x.com/David_Rudnick/status/1937471865490145711\">if war is only a weekend thing</a>. As his State Department spokeswoman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/trump-eases-pressure-on-iran-by-saying-china-can-buy-its-oil\">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I’m not going to get ahead of the president or try to guess what his strategy will be. Things happen quickly and I think we’ll find out sooner than later.</p></blockquote><p>And this gets into the tricky part of the attention economy - it’s easy to get eyeballs, sure, and people will do wilder and wilder stunts to keep eyes on them. But what happens when people stop paying attention? Here, it’s that Iran will likely continue pursuing a nuclear bomb because all they have to do to understand the narrative is watch the feed, and that holds heavy, heavy consequences. </p><h4>Zohran Mamdani</h4><p>There are many great essays on Mamdani (<a href=\"https://derekthompson.substack.com/p/what-speaks-to-me-about-abundance\">Derek Thompson just joined Substack!</a>), so I won’t belabor it too much here. But yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-25/new-yorkers-withstand-scorching-heat-to-choose-mayoral-candidate?srnd=homepage-americas\">Zohran Mamdani won the NYC Democratic Mayoral Primar</a>y. A 33-year-old democratic socialist just beat a former governor - Andrew Cuomo - by running a campaign that got a lot of attention. 4.5 months ago<a href=\"https://x.com/hecubian_devil/status/1937696976315039778\"> he was polling at 1%! </a></p><p>Most of his messaging was about <a href=\"https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1878853557111414795\">affordability</a> (which is also <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-climate-change-immigration-tariffs-young-voters-e4bd29e491d42fd989c32be8eeb2a2cb\">why Trump won among young voters</a>). He is a master of short-form video and podcasts, but he was also <em>physically</em> in NYC, again, walking the length of the city. Cuomo was advertising on TV and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-campaign-finance.html\">raised $25 million in the largest super PAC ever created in a NYC mayoral campaign</a> (!) but that simply didn’t matter</p><p>And as many have said, Mamdani is the most Trump-like candidate *in messaging* the left has produced - he had a deeply online campaign, he did every interview he could, he has a loyal base <a href=\"https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1937339211004154269\">(they knocked on 1.5 million doors!</a>), and clear messaging. </p><p>Mamdani proved attention is the path to institutional override. Just like Trump, but from the other side.</p><p>The shift isn’t that surprising, and it will happen more now, on both ends. People are largely frustrated with the status quo. There is excitement in rule bending, like JD Vance <a href=\"https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1937684913278370161\">sticking up a middle finger</a> or Trump dropping an F-bomb on C-Span. </p><p>The ideas matter, sure. People voted for Trump because <a href=\"https://apnews.com/projects/trump-campaign-promise-tracker/\">they wanted deportations and unwokeness </a>but also because he was different and new. Mamdani promises affordability and fresh new ideas. It feels like change in a world where people are not listened to.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> </p><h4>How They All Tie Together</h4><p>All three stories - Trump bombing Iran on social, Mamdani walking Manhattan on TikTok, Cluely’s raise - have one thing in common: the power came from attention, and attention came from narrative discipline. </p><p>It operates like a supply chain of sorts:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link

Cuomo concedes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pollution</strong>: Outrage cycles, factionalism, increased ideological sorting.</p></li></ul><p>Cluely fits this cycle too. When a16z funds Cluely based purely on attention capture capability, they're legitimizing attention as a fundable asset class. That sends a signal to every other founder - build for virality, not just utility. It’s American Dynamism!</p><p>Attention is the raw material of economic, political, and military action. But speculation is what operationalizes that attention: the bets people place (emotionally, politically, financially) on what narrative will become real. </p><p>And in politics, this type of speculation has become the closest thing to agency for people who feel like they are no longer served by the economy. People speculate on ideas, personalities, etc. Why wouldn’t they? But when this happens, you end up with a system optimized for speed and virality rather than stability or accuracy.</p><p>And I think that’s why there’s an informal coalition that controls resource allocation now - podcasters like Joe Rogan, YouTubers like Mr Beast, guys like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson. Elon Musk, who has not said one word about what's going on, is a narrative thermostat. They are masters of speed and virality. </p><p>They all take that speculation, determine what gets attention, which increasingly determines what gets resources. The world is learning from them now - startups, politicians, geopolitical strategy. The \"checks and balances\" no longer come from Congress or the courts, but from the feed. </p><h4>We’ve Been Here Before</h4><p>What I'm describing isn't entirely unprecedented, of course. Many have discussed<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a>. Back in 1971, Herbert Simon wrote in <a href=\"https://knowen-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/file/2005/DESIGNING%2BORGANIZATIONS%2Bfor%2BInformation-Rich%2Bworld%2B--%2BSImon.pdf\">Designing Organizations for an Information-Rich World</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.</p></blockquote><p>Information abundance creates attention scarcity! By 1997 (!) Michael Goldhaber was pushed this further with <a href=\"https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/519/440\">The Attention Economy and the Net </a>arguing that attention was becoming the new currency of the digital age. </p><blockquote><p>The attention economy brings with it its own kind of wealth, its own class divisions - stars vs. fans - and its own forms of property, all of which make it incompatible with the industrial-money-market based economy it bids fair to replace. Success will come to those who best accommodate to this new reality.</p></blockquote><p>Robert Shiller coined <em>narrative economics,</em> arguing that stories drive economic behavior. I think we are in a new iteration of all of this where the stories aren't just influencing economic activity, they <em>are</em> the economic activity. Attention is a precursor to wealth (in many ways) and speculation drives it. </p><p>Succinctly… everything feels like crypto now? Crypto doesn’t represent “real” value (some things in the industry do, but broad brushstrokes), but it synthesizes it through speculation and belief. Vibes, volatility, and mindshare, if you will. We're now living in a system where attention dynamics are the operating system for resource allocation, political decisions, and identity formation. </p><h4>What Comes Next</h4><p>This intersection of speculation and attention feels ignored outside of markets. And the question isn't whether we can build better housing or infrastructure - though we desperately need both. The question is whether we can build anything coherent when the resource allocation system rewards attention over everything else. </p><p>Because right now, the person who can generate the most compelling speculation about the future gets the most power to create it, regardless of whether they understand the consequences.</p><p>There's no neutral outside from which to observe these systems. We're building the tools that are rebuilding us, and it will have consequences across the board. There really isn't an offline anymore, just due to the administration. We're all participants in a cognitive economy that trades in attention, belief, and behavior. Shape the feed, shape the future. What happens when everything becomes an attention-speculation machine?</p><p><strong>Next week: Part 2,</strong> I’ll attempt to answer that question and walk through what could be built and the generational implications.

to Change Limiting Beliefs</p></li><li><p>Final Thoughts</p></li><li><p>BONUS</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>How Limiting Beliefs Are Formed</h2><p><strong>What Are Limiting Beliefs?</strong> Limiting beliefs are subconscious assumptions that restrict what we believe we’re capable of. Psychologists like Aaron Beck and researchers from PositivePsychology.com call them <em>negative core beliefs</em> or <em>dysfunctional schemas</em>. They act like mental filters—confirming your fears and filtering out success.</p><h3>Psychological Origins</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Learned Helplessness</strong>: Martin Seligman’s classic research showed that when faced with repeated failure or uncontrollable stress, both animals and humans begin to believe that nothing they do matters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Self-Schema Theory</strong>: Aaron Beck’s work shows that early life criticism, trauma, or neglect can form schemas like “I’m unlovable” or “I’m incapable.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Learning</strong>: Bandura’s research reminds us that we often internalize beliefs modeled by parents, peers, and culture—especially when combined with negative emotional experiences.</p></li></ul><h3>Neurological Roots</h3><ul><li><p>Our brains <strong>encode beliefs</strong> through repeated emotional experiences. “Neurons that fire together, wire together.”</p></li><li><p>Beliefs—especially negative ones—become <strong>strong neural pathways</strong>. The amygdala tags negative experiences as dangerous, reinforcing fear-based beliefs.</p></li><li><p>Evaluating beliefs (true/false) activates prefrontal and emotional brain areas. Strong beliefs often provide a familiar emotional payoff—even if they’re harmful.</p></li></ul><h3>Developmental Patterns</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Before age 7</strong>, children absorb beliefs from their environment without question.</p></li><li><p>Early messages like “You’re too sensitive” or “Stop being lazy” become <em>internalized truths</em>.</p></li><li><p>Psychologist Jeffrey Young’s schema therapy identifies 18 early maladaptive schemas formed from unmet needs like safety, connection, or validation.</p></li></ul><h3>Social &amp; Cultural Influence</h3><ul><li><p>Beliefs are also <em>inherited</em> socially: from media, school, religion, and stereotypes.</p></li><li><p>Internalized racism, sexism, or classism can form beliefs like “people like me don’t belong.”</p></li><li><p>Social psychology experiments (like stereotype threat) show how even a subtle cue can make a belief self-fulfilling.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>How to Identify Limiting Beliefs</h2><p><strong>You can’t change what you can’t see.</strong></p><p>Here are ways to uncover the beliefs behind your emotional or behavioral patterns:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Automatic Thought Journals</strong>: Track moments of emotional intensity. Write the event, your reaction, and what you told yourself.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Downward Arrow Technique</strong>: Ask “What does that mean about me?” repeatedly until you hit a core assumption (e.g. “I’m worthless if I fail.”)</p></li><li><p><strong>Sentence Completion</strong>: Fill in blanks like “I am…”, “Others are…”, or “The world is…” to reveal subconscious beliefs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Behavioral Clues</strong>: Avoidance, perfectionism, people-pleasing, or chronic self-sabotage often point to unspoken limiting beliefs.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>How to Change Limiting Beliefs</h2><h3>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3><ul><li><p>Use <strong>Socratic questioning</strong> to evaluate your belief like a scientist.</p></li><li><p>Ask: “Is it true? What’s the evidence? What’s a more balanced belief?”</p></li><li><p>Example: Replace “I’m a failure” with “I’ve failed before—and learned and grown.”</p></li></ul><h3>Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)</h3><ul><li><p>Change the language and imagery of your thoughts.</p></li><li><p>Example: Replace “I can’t do this” with “I haven’t learned this <em>yet</em>.”</p></li><li><p>Try the “as-if” frame: Act as if you already believed the empowering version.</p></li></ul><h3>Mindfulness &amp; ACT</h3><ul><li><p>Notice your thoughts with distance: “I’m having the thought that I’m not good enough.”</p></li><li><p>Practice self-compassion: “This is hard—and I’m doing my best.”</p></li><li><p>Use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to act <em>despite</em> the limiting belief.</p></li></ul><h3>Coaching &amp; Action-Based Interventions</h3><ul><li><p>Set a challenge that tests the belief (e.g. speak publicly if you believe “I can’t speak”).</p></li><li><p>Use visualization: Mentally rehearse success.</p></li><li><p>Try the “And” Exercise: “I’m not confident AND I can learn with practice.”</p></li><li><p>Surround yourself with people who <em>disprove</em> your belief by example.</p></li></ul><h3>Hypnosis in Belief Change</h3><p>Hypnosis can help access the subconscious where many limiting beliefs live. In a relaxed state, hypnotherapy enables:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Regression work</strong>: to identify the first time the belief took root.</p></li><li><p><strong>Suggestion work</strong>: planting empowering beliefs like “I am capable” while the mind is most receptive.</p></li><li><p>Research shows that hypnosis, when integrated with CBT or coaching, can <strong>accelerate belief change</strong>, reduce anxiety, and increase self-confidence.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Your beliefs are not your destiny.</p><p>They are stories the mind wrote based on past pain, fear, and inherited narratives. But with awareness and practice, you can revise the script.</p><p>✅ Understand how they formed </p><p>✅ Identify the voice of the belief </p><p>✅ Try different belief-changing techniques </p><p>✅ Take small action in a new direction</p><p><strong>Beliefs can change—and when they do, so does everything else.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em><strong>With care and curiosity,</strong></em></p><p><em>Andreas</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>BONUS</h2><p><strong>THANKS FOR READING.

It’s essential to understand what VCs look for, build relevant knowledge, and stay close to the ecosystem.</p><h2>❇️ 5 Proven Ways to Stand Out</h2><p>You don’t need a Harvard MBA or a McKinsey badge. You need proof that you think and act like an investor.</p><h3>🔹Start Building a Personal Portfolio</h3><p>Start investing however you can:</p><ul><li><p>Angel Investing. </p></li><li><p>Syndicates (e.g. AngelList, Odin, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Crowdfunding platforms (e.g. Crowdcube, Dozen, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Write public investment theses &amp; “mock portfolios”.</p></li></ul><p>This proves pattern recognition, conviction, and initiative. Show you’re already acting like a VC.</p><h3>🔹Send Monthly Dealflow to VCs </h3><p>Choose partners at firms you admire and want to work with. Every month, email them <strong>1-2 startups</strong> they should meet. Keep it simple:</p><ul><li><p>A 1-liner on why the startup is interesting.</p></li><li><p>How it matches their thesis. Study their portfolio and learn their style.</p></li></ul><p>After 2 or 3 months, they’ll know your name and your judgment. They'll start replying to your messages and keep you top of mind in case they're hiring.</p><h3>🔹Help Partners Fundraise</h3><p>Most people forget this: GPs struggle with LP fundraising. If you can:</p><ul><li><p>Introduce warm LPs.</p></li><li><p>Recommend useful lists or materials for fundraising (Family Offices, Fund of Funds, etc.).</p></li></ul><p>You’ll instantly stand out.</p><h3>🔹Build a Network</h3><p>Venture is a relationship business. Attend events. DM people. Stay visible, helpful, and curious:</p><ul><li><p>Source startups.</p></li><li><p>Share insights.</p></li><li><p>Analyze trends.</p></li><li><p>Support VCs work.</p></li></ul><h3>🔹 Launch Something Yourself</h3><p>VCs love builders. It doesn’t have to be big. Build a community, launch a newsletter, help a founder. Anything that shows you know how to operate will set you apart from the others.</p><p>Action &gt; polish. Doers stand out.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://luisllorens.substack.com/p/how-to-break-into-venture-capital?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://luisllorens.substack.com/p/how-to-break-into-venture-capital?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p><h2>❇️ Venture Resources</h2><p><em>No fluff.

Flaticon</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Over the past few years, I’ve created more than a dozen digital products and generated multiple six figures in digital product sales.</p><p>I’ve created everything from e-books, 30-day challenges, digital templates, Notion databases, and online courses.</p><p>I first started doing this in the productivity space with my business, <em>Peak Productivity</em>.</p><p>Now I’m doing the same thing here at <em>Write • Build • Scale</em>, where we focus on helping creators build a thriving online business.</p><p>And while I’ve made plenty of mistakes along the way (trust me, more than I’d like to admit), I now feel confident saying that I know how to build a digital product people <em>actually want to buy.</em></p><p>So in this article, I’m sharing 10 key lessons I’ve learned from building and launching 10+ digital products.</p><p>Lessons that will help you skip the mistakes, move faster, and turn your knowledge into real revenue.</p><p>Let’s dive in.</p><h2>#1: Keep It Simple</h2><p>If you’re working on your first digital product, start small and keep it simple.</p><p>You don’t need to create the ultimate product right away. In fact, I’d strongly recommend that you don’t.</p><p>Start small instead.</p><p>What does that look like?</p><ul><li><p>Instead of a 200-page e-book, write a focused 50-page guide</p></li><li><p>Instead of a 30-day challenge, begin with a 7 or 14-day challenge</p></li><li><p>Instead of a giant signature course, create a mini-course that teaches one specific skill in under 2 hours</p></li></ul><p>When you start small, it’s less intimidating to create. You’re way more likely to actually finish (and launch) it.</p><p>So many creators get stuck in perfectionism or overwhelm because they try to do too much with their first product, and they never end up releasing it. </p><p>Don’t fall into that trap.</p><p>Also, lots of creators think that “more = more value.” But that’s not true. </p><p>Your audience is busy. They don’t want 100 videos or a 300-page book, they want results as quickly as possible. </p><p>In many cases, a short and focused product that solves a specific problem fast is way more valuable than a bloated, all-in-one program.</p><p>So if you’re building your first digital product, resist the urge to go big. Keep it small and keep it simple. </p><p>Your goal should be to launch it quickly, so you build momentum.</p><h3>#2: Offer a Clear Transformation</h3><p>One reason why many digital products flop is that the transformation isn’t clear enough.</p><p><em>You</em> might understand how valuable <em>your</em> product is. </p><p><em>You</em> know how much time, energy, and insight went into it. </p><p><strong>But that doesn’t matter if your customer can’t clearly see what’s in it for them.</strong></p><p>That means you need to answer three crucial questions:</p><ul><li><p>What problem does this product help solve?</p></li><li><p>What challenge does it help people overcome?</p></li><li><p>What result or outcome does it help them achieve?</p></li></ul><p>This is what makes your product valuable. </p><p>Not how long it is, not how many lessons or downloads it includes. It’s about the change it creates in someone’s life or business.</p><p>Remember, people don’t buy digital products for the <em>information</em>. They buy them for the <em>transformation</em>.</p><p>Give them a transformation worth paying for.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>#3: Validate Before You Build</h3><p>Here’s a painful lesson I had to learn the hard way: Just because <em>you</em> think your digital product idea is amazing doesn’t mean other people do.</p><p>One of the biggest mistakes I see new creators make is jumping straight into building mode without first checking if anyone even wants what they’re building. </p><p>And that’s how people end up spending <em>weeks</em> creating a product… only for it to flop on launch day.</p><p>So before you build anything, validate that there’s actual demand. How you validate demand depends on whether or not you already have an audience.</p><h4>If You Don’t Have an Audience Yet:</h4><p>Your best strategy is to do market research. Look around and see if your idea already exists, and if it’s already selling.</p><p>If other creators have been selling the same ebook, course, or template for a year - and still promote it - that likely means it’s <em>profitable</em>. </p><p>People are buying it. There’s demand. That’s your green light.</p><p>Now you might be wondering:</p><blockquote><p>“How can I compete with them if the product already exists?”</p></blockquote><p>Well, even if your product idea isn’t 100% unique, your approach, your teaching style, your story, your beliefs, and your way of explaining things might be.</p><p>People will buy your product when they trust you and feel connected with you, even if the same exact product is already created by someone else.</p><h4>If You Do Have an Audience:</h4><p>If you already have an online audience, validating demand becomes easier.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Build a waitlist: </strong>Create a quick landing page describing your idea and invite your audience to join the waitlist to get an early-bird discount when it’s released. If you get a lot of sign-ups, it’s a strong signal of interest. If barely anyone signs up, that’s also valuable feedback.</p></li><li><p><strong>Run a pre-order campaign: </strong>Create a basic sales page <em>before</em> building your product. You explain the concept, promise a launch date (say, 30 days from now), and offer a big discount or bonus for people who buy now. If you get enough sales: great, the idea is validated.</p></li></ul><p>All in all, always validate your product idea.</p><p>Don’t confuse personal excitement for market demand. Just because <em>you</em> think it’s a brilliant idea doesn’t automatically mean people will pay for it.</p><p>Validate first. It could save you <em>a lot</em> of time, energy, and frustration.</p><h3>#4: Use The Right Tools</h3><p>The right tools and software can help you build your digital product faster, easier, and make it more profitable. </p><p>Here are the exact tools I use to build, sell, and automate my digital products:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Loom</strong> – I use this to record video lessons for my online courses. Super quick and easy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Canva</strong> – This is where I create slides for my videos and design workbooks, checklists, and templates. No design background needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>LeadPages</strong> – My go-to tool for building high-converting sales pages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thinkific</strong> – I use this to host all of my courses and digital products. It also handles payments and gives buyers instant access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kit (previously ConvertKit)</strong> – This is where I set up automated email funnels that sell my products on autopilot.</p></li><li><p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> – From outlining digital products to writing scripts, brainstorming, writing sales copy, and even creating bonus resources, ChatGPT speeds up everything and takes a lot of the mental friction away.</p></li></ul><p>Now, if you’re just getting started and want a low-cost option that does <em>almost</em> everything in one place, check out Gumroad.</p><p>It’s beginner-friendly, free to get started, and it handles sales pages, payment processing, and hosting for your digital products or courses. </p><p>They just take a small cut of each sale, which is perfect when you're new and not ready to pay $99/month for every tool under the sun.</p><h3>#5: Learn Copywriting</h3><p>Copywriting is one of the most important skills for any digital creator. </p><p>You can have the best course, the most helpful e-book, or the most valuable set of templates out there, but if you can’t communicate the value of it <strong>clearly</strong> and <strong>persuasively</strong>, nobody’s going to buy it.</p><p>Without copywriting, you won’t be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Write a sales page that actually converts</p></li><li><p>Write marketing emails that build excitement and drive sales</p></li><li><p>Describe your product in a way that makes people say, “I need this”</p></li></ul><p>One of the most valuable copywriting lessons I learned is to focus more on the <strong>benefits</strong> of your offer, and not so much on the <strong>features</strong> of your offer.</p><p>But most product creators do the reverse. </p><p>They’ll say things like:</p><ul><li><p>This course includes 17 lessons and 5 hours of video</p></li><li><p>This e-book is 187 pages long</p></li><li><p>This product took me 3 months to create</p></li></ul><p>That’s good to mention once, but it’s not what people <em>really</em> care about. If most of your marketing message is on the features, you’re not going to sell much.</p><p>Instead, people care about:</p><ul><li><p>Will this help me solve the problem I’m struggling with?</p></li><li><p>Will this help me get the result I want faster or easier?</p></li><li><p>Will this give me the transformation I’ve been chasing?</p></li></ul><p>That’s the <em>real</em> value. And that’s what your copy needs to highlight—on your sales page, in your marketing emails, in your social posts. Everywhere.</p><p>So if you’re serious about making money online, take the time to learn the basics of copywriting.</p><p>You don’t need to be a master. But you <em>do</em> need to know how to talk about your product in a way that makes people want to buy.</p><p>Because if your copy doesn’t spark interest, it doesn’t matter how great your product is. No interest = no sales.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>#6: Different Format = Different Price Point</h3><p>You can teach the same thing, solve the same problem, and offer the same transformation, but the format you choose for your digital product will drastically change how much you can charge for it.</p><p>Say you package your knowledge into an e-book. Unless you’re incredibly famous or your book has gone viral, you’re going to have a hard time selling it for more than $20.</p><p>(And even $20 is on the high end for most e-books.)</p><p>Now take that <em>same</em> content, but package it into a mini-course—with videos, slides, maybe a workbook—and suddenly, you can price it at $50, $75, even $100+.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because the perceived value of an online course is much higher than an e-book, even if the <em>actual content</em> is pretty much the same.</p><p>And this applies to other formats too:</p><ul><li><p>A 30-day challenge might sell for $27–$47</p></li><li><p>A toolkit or template bundle could go for $19–$49</p></li><li><p>A cohort-based program might sell for $300–$1,000+</p></li></ul><p>Same core content. Different format. Way different pricing.</p><p>That’s why for my productivity business, I focused almost exclusively on creating online mini-courses.</p><p>I knew I could charge $97 for something that might only be worth $15 as an e-book.</p><p>Same outcome. Same content. Just a more profitable delivery format.</p><p>Now, I’m not saying you <em>shouldn’t</em> create e-books. If that’s your preferred style, go for it. </p><p>But just know: your format determines your price point. And your price point determines your profitability.</p><h3>#7: Have Upsells Available</h3><p>It’s way easier to sell to an existing customer than to find a new one. In fact, studies show that someone who’s already bought from you is<strong> 76% more likely </strong>to buy again.</p><p>That’s why every time you sell a digital product, whether it’s a $49 mini-course or a $19 template, you should have an upsell ready.</p><p>Say someone buys your online course. Awesome.</p><p>But what if, on the checkout page, you offered a relevant add-on (like a bundle of templates, a toolkit, or a workbook) for $15 or $25?</p><p>That’s called an order bump, and it works like magic. It’s a no-brainer, impulse-buy that increases your average order value with almost zero extra effort.</p><p>Then, after the sale, either in the confirmation email or a follow-up email sequence, you can introduce a higher-ticket upsell.</p><p>This could be:</p><ul><li><p>A 1-on-1 coaching call</p></li><li><p>A more in-depth digital product</p></li><li><p>A VIP experience or group consulting package</p></li></ul><p>The idea is simple: <strong>don’t stop at one sale.</strong></p><p>If you’ve already earned someone’s trust and they’ve paid you once, why not offer them something else that provides additional value to them?</p><p>So when you’re creating your digital products, ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p>What’s a low-ticket add-on I can offer as an order bump?</p></li><li><p>What’s a premium offer I can make on the back end?</p></li></ul><p>More value for them. More revenue for you. </p><p>Win-win.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3>#8: Build a Simple Sales Funnel</h3><p>A sales funnel might sound complicated and intimidating, but it’s not.</p><p>All a sales funnel really is, is a system that helps people go from discovering you to buying your digital product.</p><p>Let me break down a few simple ways to do this.</p><h4>The Content Funnel:</h4><p>This is the easiest funnel to set up.</p><p>You just link to your digital product inside your content, whether that’s a Substack post, a newsletter, or a blog article.</p><p>This works great for low-ticket products (think $7 – $97). Something that people can buy impulsively without much hesitation.</p><p>So, if you’re writing a post about productivity, and you have a mini-course on deep work or time-blocking, simply drop a link to that course somewhere in the post.</p><p>Do this often enough (without spamming the link, but placing it strategically), and you’ll make sales.</p><h4>The Email Funnel:</h4><p>This one takes a bit more time to set up, but it can generate sales for you on autopilot.</p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><ol><li><p>In your content, promote a freebie (like a helpful PDF guide, an email course, or a checklist)</p></li><li><p>People sign up with their email address to get it</p></li><li><p>Then you add them to an automated email sequence (via Kit, for example)</p></li><li><p>A few emails into that email sequence, you introduce your digital product</p></li></ol><p>This system works especially well for mid-tier products ($97 - $497), where people need a little more warming up before they’re ready to buy.</p><p>The beauty of this is that once you’ve set it up, it runs on autopilot in the background.</p><p>You can simply focus on creating content and building your audience, while your email funnel turns new readers into paying customers without your active involvement.</p><h3>#9: Collect and Leverage Testimonials</h3><p>You saying your digital product is awesome is one thing. But when other people say your product is awesome, that’s when trust skyrockets (and sales follow).</p><p>Think about your own buying behavior. When you're on Amazon or booking an Airbnb, what’s one of the first things you check? </p><p>The reviews.</p><p>Well, your potential customers do the same thing.</p><p>They want to hear from real people who bought your product, used it, and got positive results.</p><p>That’s why collecting and sharing testimonials is one of the smartest things you can do to increase your conversions.</p><p>Whenever someone buys your digital product, follow up:</p><ul><li><p>Send them a quick email or DM after a few days</p></li><li><p>Ask them how they’re enjoying the product</p></li><li><p>Ask if they’d be open to sharing a few lines about what they liked or what result they got</p></li></ul><p>You’d be surprised how many people are happy to share something when you just ask.</p><p>Once you’ve got those testimonials, use them:</p><ul><li><p>Add them to your sales page</p></li><li><p>Share them in your marketing emails</p></li><li><p>Sprinkle them in your content (the occasional Substack Note, for example)</p></li></ul><p>Testimonials build trust. And trust converts.</p><h3>#10: Improve Your Digital Product As You Go</h3><p>Your digital product doesn’t have to be “perfect” when you launch it.</p><p>In fact, it won’t be. And that’s totally okay.</p><p>Perfection is the enemy of progress. If you wait until every module, every design, every sentence is “perfect,” you’ll never hit publish.</p><p>What really matters is that it helps your customer go from A to B. When that’s the case, launch it.</p><p>Once you’ve made your first sales, you’ll start getting real feedback from real customers.</p><p>They’ll tell you:</p><ul><li><p>What they loved the most</p></li><li><p>What confused them</p></li><li><p>What’s missing</p></li><li><p>What could make it even more useful</p></li></ul><p>That feedback is gold.</p><p>Use it to upgrade your product. Improve your examples. Add bonus lessons. Re-record a video or two. Polish the workbook. Tweak the onboarding process.</p><p>Version 2.0 and 3.0 of your product will be way more impactful, simply because you’ve built it around what your customers <em>actually want</em>.</p><p>And the better your product becomes, the more confident <em>you</em> get in selling it.</p><p>When you know your product delivers, you’ll feel more comfortable promoting it, raising the price, running a launch, adding it to your funnel, etc.</p><p>So don’t fall into the perfection trap.</p><p>Just launch. Get it out there. Improve it as you go.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://writebuildscale.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>"

Meta also considered acquiring Ilya Sutskever’s SSI (last valued at $32B), Perplexity (last valued at $14B), and is offering 9-figure pay packages for AI researchers to join Meta’s superintelligence team (total spend could be up to $5B).</p><p>So, Meta was prepared to spend <s>at least $30B</s>, err let me rephrase, <em>whatever it takes</em> to be competitive at the leading edge of AI.</p><p>This is apparently in response to the underperformance of Meta’s model developments, from <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/\">Stratechery</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The proximate cause for this reevaluation is the apparent five alarm fire that is happening at Meta: the company’s latest Llama 4 release was disappointing — and in at least one case, deceptive — pushing founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to go on a major spending spree for talent.</em></p></blockquote><p>This will not be an analysis of whether or not these investments will work, but rather why they’re making these investments. Similar to my arguments on big tech’s CapEx investments, this is all logical. In summary, Meta has:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Personal motivations:</strong> Meta’s history of conflict with the platform they sit on top of (Apple) has led to a “do anything necessary” mentality to own the next big platform.</p></li><li><p><strong>Profitable applications of AI:</strong> Meta has one of the most profitable applications of AI in the world (advertising systems) to justify ROI on these investments.</p></li><li><p><strong>An unsatisfactory rate of progress:</strong> Meta’s not making the progress Zuck wants to in AI. Of the three largest paths towards model improvements (compute, data, and talent/algorithms), talent is the most differentiated today.</p></li><li><p><strong>Incentives + no reasonable alternative:</strong> Meta has the applications to profit from AI (carrot) + a risk of relying on someone else for the next big platform shift (stick) + no reasonable investment alternative ($20B in profit last quarter!) = play the AI arms race.</p></li></ol><p>If we squint, we can see the big vision for AI take form: a personal assistant at our fingertips, with context on our lives, that gets better as it becomes more powerful and more personalized. As it gets more integrated into our lives, it gets harder to replace.</p><p>The window to become that personal assistant is closing. This is the prize Meta is chasing, and the risk of underinvesting towards that vision is far greater than the risk of overinvesting.</p><p>This will be a rundown of Meta’s AI strategy, their motivations from past scars, the current state of their tech, and their vision for the future.</p><h2>I. Some Historical Context</h2><p>Three pieces of important historical context to understand Meta’s motivations:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Meta initially viewed themselves, and has always had the aspirations to be, a platform company.</strong></p></li></ol><p>This started with the Facebook platform in the early 2010s, enabling companies to build apps on top of Facebook’s ecosystem (you guys remember Farmville?). In the early days, the platform was just as important as advertising in the eyes of Zuck and the team.</p><p>However, as mobile took off, it became clear Facebook was a mobile <em><strong>application</strong></em>, but the mobile <em><strong>platform</strong></em> would be Apple’s. And that fact has caused Zuck as much stress as any other:</p><blockquote><p><em>\"There are all these things that, over time, Google—but especially Apple—have prevented us from doing, even though I think they would be good for consumers. At some point, we ran the numbers and realized that if we were able to do all the things we thought were beneficial—considering the additional engagement, increased app usage, and avoiding various fees—I think we might be twice as profitable as a company as we are now.\"</em> - Zuck in a Stripe Sessions Interview (lightly edited for clarity)</p></blockquote><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>To avoid that pain again, Meta made two opinionated bets on the platforms of the future in the early 2010s: AR/VR and AI.</strong></p></li></ol><p>For AR/VR, Meta acquired Oculus for $2B in 2014. As has been well-documented, they’ve spent well over $60 billion in pursuit of owning that platform.</p><p>For AI, they hired Yann LeCun in 2013, as well as other top AI researchers, and developed a near duopoly on top AI talent with Google. FAIR (now Meta AI) became one of the most respected AI research labs in the world.</p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Meta created one of the most profitable applications of AI of any company in the world.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Meta has profitably spent tens (perhaps hundreds) of billions of dollars on GPUs. Digital advertising is one of the most profitable businesses in history, and there are only three ways to increase revenue: increase users, increase screen time, or increase the likelihood that an ad converts to a purchase.</p><p>Meta’s recommendation systems are the best way to capitalize on the third variable, taking all the data they have and personalizing ads based on that data. Before spending GPUs on training Llama, this is what all those GPUs Meta purchased were for (and many of them still are):</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1080,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z6zX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F46b549dc-e857-4747-93d6-fdeb1176bb1e_1080x1080.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">2023 Nvidia GPU Shipments by Customer</figcaption></figure></div><p>In summary, Zuck’s personally and financially motivated to own the next platform, and he doesn’t care what price it takes to do so.</p><h2>II.

Meta’s Vision for AI</h2><p>Zuck has described a few ~big~ opportunities for Meta in AI:</p><p><strong>1. Creating “The Ultimate Business Results Machine”</strong></p><p>Meta’s advertising engine has become so good that they know business’ customers far better than they do in most cases. This advertising black box is the clearest path to AI ROI for Meta.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-about-ai-and-the-evolution-of-social-media/\">Stratechery interview</a>, Zuck described what this system would look like:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Improve recommendations, make it so that any business that basically wants to achieve some business outcome can just come to us, not have to produce any content, not have to know anything about their customers. Can just say, “Here’s the business outcome that I want, here’s what I’m willing to pay, I’m going to connect you to my bank account, I will pay you for as many business outcomes as you can achieve.” </em>(lightly edited for clarity)</p></blockquote><p><strong>2.

Well, the third epoch is I think that there’s going to be all this AI-generated content and you’re not going to lose the others, you’re still going to have all the creator content, you’re still going to have some of the friend content.” </em>(lightly edited for clarity)</p></blockquote><p>However, as referenced earlier, the big vision Zuck’s fighting for with these AI investments is a personalized and ever-present AI. Again, the ROI is increased engagement on the platform, leading to more advertising dollars.</p><p><strong>3. The General Purpose AI Assistant</strong></p><p>This is the biggest prize on the AI field right now. Viewed through this lens, OpenAI’s Jony Ive acquisition makes sense. The importance of memory becomes clear. The future is a world where you have your assistant with you at all times, and whoever owns this, has pole position on being <em>the AI company</em>. It’s what OpenAI, Meta, and Google are fighting for.</p><blockquote><p><em>\"There are two primary values we're aiming to deliver. On the AR and mixed reality side, our main goal is to create a strong sense of presence. The other major focus is personalized AI, which is where Llama, Meta AI, and related efforts come in. There's a lot of ongoing development to make these models increasingly intelligent, but I think things will become truly compelling when the AI is personalized specifically for you.\" - </em>Zuck on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7OduG1YmI\">Huge if True</a> (lightly edited for clarity)</p></blockquote><p>Meta’s got user data, the lead in AR/VR/AI glasses, and they’ve got a model that could be in the race for the leading edge. They’re well-positioned to compete for this prize, and it’s the one that’s got to be top of mind for Meta when making these investments.</p><h2>IV. How do they achieve that vision (hint: people still matter)?</h2><p>We’ve now come full circle. Meta and Zuck have the personal scars, the financial motivation, and the vision for their AI future. But how do they get there?</p><p>There are three primary vectors of improvement for AI: compute (GPUs/data centers/energy), data, and algorithms (as a proxy for human talent).

This artificial intelligence-driven startup has recently made headlines by securing a Series C funding round, valued at a staggering $3 billion. This leap in valuation is not just a number; it’s a testament to the growing demand for innovative solutions in sales and marketing.<br>Founded in 2017, Clay Labs has carved a niche in the competitive landscape of AI.

Two companies, Lenskart and Applied Intuition, have recently captured headlines with their soaring valuations. Each represents a different facet of the tech landscape, yet both share a common thread: investor confidence.<br>Lenskart, the omnichannel eyewear retailer, has seen its valuation rise to $6.1 billion, a notable increase from $5.6 billion just months prior. This leap comes as the company prepares for an initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise $1 billion at a projected valuation of $10 billion. The momentum is palpable. Lenskart’s journey began in 2010, and it has evolved into a major player in India’s consumer retail market, seamlessly blending e-commerce with physical stores.</p><h3>3. <strong><a href=\"https://parsers.vc/news/250618-the-genetic-gamble--23andme-s-resurrection/?utm_source=newsletter.parsers.vc&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=parsers-vc-weekly-funding-startup-vc-news-of-june-24-2025&amp;_bhlid=563f367ef89af78fae659e177527fc1b3a3381d3\">The Genetic Gamble: 23andMe's Resurrection and the Fluoride Debate </a></strong></h3><p><em>(Cited in 12 tech media)</em></p><p>In the world of biotech, fortunes can shift like sand. Just look at 23andMe. Once a titan of genetic testing, it faced a steep decline, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2025. But now, a phoenix rises from the ashes. Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and former CEO, is back in the driver’s seat. Her nonprofit, TTAM Research Institute, has snagged 23andMe’s assets for $305 million. This acquisition isn’t just a financial maneuver; it’s a lifeline for a company that once promised to revolutionize personal genomics.<br>Wojcicki’s return is a classic tale of redemption. After stepping down amid financial turmoil, she has orchestrated a comeback. Her bid outpaced Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which had initially planned to acquire the company for $256 million. In a twist worthy of a Hollywood script, Wojcicki reopened the auction and emerged victorious. The deal includes 23andMe’s Personal Genome Service and its telehealth subsidiary, Lemonaid Health. It’s a significant win for Wojcicki, who aims to reignite the company’s mission: to help people access and understand their genetic information.</p><h3>4. <strong><a href=\"https://parsers.vc/news/250618-meta-s-bold-ai-moves--a-high-stakes-game-of/?utm_source=newsletter.parsers.vc&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=parsers-vc-weekly-funding-startup-vc-news-of-june-24-2025&amp;_bhlid=707e98d11c2ebfa16f135ad0cba3d9ec0ea942ed\">Meta's Bold AI Moves: A High-Stakes Game of Strategy and Scrutiny</a></strong> </h3><p><em>(Cited in 11 tech media)</em></p><p>Meta Platforms is playing a high-stakes game in the world of artificial intelligence. With a recent $14.8 billion investment in Scale AI, the company is betting big on its future. This deal is not just a financial maneuver; it’s a strategic pivot that could redefine Meta’s role in the tech landscape. As the dust settles, the implications of this investment ripple through the industry, raising questions about competition, regulation, and the future of AI.<br>Meta's investment in Scale AI is a calculated risk. It’s a move that positions the company at the forefront of AI development. Scale AI specializes in data labeling, a crucial step in training AI models. By acquiring a significant stake in this startup, Meta aims to enhance its capabilities in artificial intelligence. The deal gives Meta a 49% nonvoting stake, allowing it to tap into Scale's resources without triggering regulatory scrutiny. This clever structuring is a testament to Meta's understanding of the current regulatory climate.</p><h3>5. <strong><a href=\"https://parsers.vc/news/250617-sword-health-s-bold-leap-into-mental-health/?utm_source=newsletter.parsers.vc&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=parsers-vc-weekly-funding-startup-vc-news-of-june-24-2025&amp;_bhlid=b190cc501601b35db9456fc515ccf2c8ee27f270\">Sword Health's Bold Leap into Mental Health: A New Era of Care</a></strong> </h3><p><em>(Cited in 11 tech media)</em></p><p>In a world where mental health struggles often go unnoticed, Sword Health is stepping into the spotlight. The company recently raised $40 million, pushing its valuation to a staggering $4 billion. This funding, led by General Catalyst, is not just a financial boost; it’s a declaration of intent. Sword Health is ready to redefine mental health care.<br>The launch of Mind, their new AI-powered mental health solution, is a game changer. Traditional therapy often feels like a fleeting moment in time. A 40-minute session every few weeks can’t capture the daily battles many face. Mind aims to change that. It’s a proactive, always-on support system that integrates artificial intelligence with licensed clinicians. This combination promises to deliver continuous, personalized care.</p><h3>6. <strong><a href=\"https://parsers.vc/news/250618-navigating-economic-crossroads--the-u-s/?utm_source=newsletter.parsers.vc&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=parsers-vc-weekly-funding-startup-vc-news-of-june-24-2025&amp;_bhlid=e9360a8c085c38ece23404aa5bdd80b930bd609b\">Navigating Economic Crossroads: The U.S. and China in 2025</a></strong> </h3><p><em>(Cited in 10 tech media)</em></p><p>The economic landscape in 2025 resembles a turbulent sea. Waves of uncertainty crash against the shores of growth and inflation. Investors and policymakers are grappling with the specter of stagflation in the U.S. Meanwhile, China is trying to reignite its economic engine after a prolonged slowdown. Both nations are at a crossroads, facing challenges that could reshape their futures.<br>In the U.S., the June CNBC Fed Survey paints a picture of cautious optimism. Investors expect the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady for now, with cuts anticipated later in the year. The consensus among economists, fund managers, and analysts is that the Fed will not act until September. This reflects a broader sentiment of uncertainty, particularly regarding trade policies. A staggering 71% of respondents express doubts about the future of tariffs, a lingering shadow over economic forecasts.</p><h3>7. <strong><a href=\"https://parsers.vc/news/250619-texas-instruments--a-dual-commitment-to/?utm_source=newsletter.parsers.vc&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=parsers-vc-weekly-funding-startup-vc-news-of-june-24-2025&amp;_bhlid=bcce75be532976bb2e89bcdefd9febad9e644aba\">Texas Instruments: A Dual Commitment to Community and Industry</a></strong> </h3><p><em>(Cited in 9 tech media)</em></p><p>Texas Instruments (TI) is a name synonymous with innovation in the semiconductor industry. But beyond the silicon chips and circuits, the company is making waves in the community. With a recent $1 million grant to the North Texas Food Bank (NTFB), TI is not just investing in technology; it’s investing in humanity. This dual commitment—supporting local communities while expanding its manufacturing footprint—paints a picture of a company that understands the importance of balance.<br>The grant to NTFB is part of a larger strategic initiative called \"Fulfilling Futures.\" This initiative aims to tackle hunger in North Texas, a region where food insecurity is alarmingly high. With nearly 5.4 million Texans facing hunger, the need is urgent. The grant will provide 3 million meals, a lifeline for many families struggling to put food on the table. It’s a drop in the bucket, but every meal counts.</p><h3>8. <strong><a href=\"https://parsers.vc/news/250618-extend-s-17-million-funding--a-leap-into/?utm_source=newsletter.parsers.vc&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=parsers-vc-weekly-funding-startup-vc-news-of-june-24-2025&amp;_bhlid=956c830adfec46c3981fd63e6026dc121a92dca4\">Extend's $17 Million Funding: A Leap into Document Processing Revolution</a></strong> </h3><p><em>(Cited in 9 tech media)</em></p><p>In the bustling world of technology, where innovation is the lifeblood, Extend has emerged as a formidable player.

    "content": "<p>AI-driven workloads demand massive computational power and generate vast amounts of sensitive data, making AI data centers prime targets for cyber threats. Traditional security models often fail to protect AI environments due to their unique traffic patterns, high East-West communication, and dynamic workload scaling.</p><p>In this post, we’ll explore the biggest security challenges in AI data centers and how Cisco, Juniper, and Palo Alto Networks provide solutions to protect AI infrastructure without sacrificing performance.</p><h3><strong>The Challenge: Security Risks in AI Data Centers</strong></h3><p>AI workloads introduce several security vulnerabilities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lateral Movement Threats:</strong> AI clusters generate high East-West traffic, increasing the risk of lateral attacks if a single node is compromised.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Data Poisoning &amp; Model Theft:</strong> Attackers can manipulate AI training data or exfiltrate valuable AI models, disrupting business operations.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Insider Threats &amp; Unauthorized Access:</strong> Large-scale AI training often involves multiple teams and partners, making access control critical.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><strong>Performance Impact of Traditional Security:</strong> Standard firewalls and IPS solutions often introduce latency, negatively affecting AI training and inference.</p></li></ul><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\"

I know I sound like a broken record on this one… but it’s TRUE!</p><p>And activation starts going wrong the minute you <a href=\"https://www.elenaverna.com/p/hey-b2b-i-bet-you-are-measuring-activation\">incorrectly define</a> your “aha” moment.</p><p>I see many companies confusing activation with setup. They define it as uploading, importing, configuring, generating, creating, or connecting something.</p><p>But do these steps always deliver value to users? Nope. So those are setup actions.</p><p>Your “aha” happens when value is <em><strong>delivered</strong></em>, not when setup ends. So verbs should be: publish, send, receive, share, export, deploy. For example:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">SurveyMonkey</a></strong>: “Aha” is not creating a survey, it’s getting responses on that survey.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"https://miro.com/\">Miro</a></strong>: It’s not opening a board and adding elements, it’s collaborating with somebody else on that board.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"https://lovable.dev/\">Lovable</a></strong>: It’s not building an app, it’s launching and getting traffic to it.</p></li></ul><p>Is reaching “aha” once enough to activate users? It depends.</p><p>In some products, yes:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.lovable.dev\">Lovable</a></strong>: Once users publish the app, they’ll iterate on it. No need for additional setups, such as publishing another app.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=\"https://amplitude.com/\">Amplitude</a></strong>: When the data is connected, users keep getting value without having to go through setup again my monitoring a metric.</p></li></ul><p>These are the “easier” cases. Then, there are those products that require you to go through setup over, and over, and over again. For example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>SurveyMonkey</strong>: Once the survey finishes collecting responses, customers have to return and create another one to continue receiving value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Miro</strong>: One white board can only last so long. That makes habit loop formation more important, so users keep coming back to create more boards.</p></li></ul><p>Cases like these are the reason why companies like Miro moved “aha” to the team level. Relying on a single user to trigger setup again and again is hard, but a team working across shared boards benefits from network effects. </p><h2><strong>It continues with failed feature adoption</strong></h2><p>Even after successful activation, some users still churn.</p><p>The culprit: they never discover the features that truly matter to them.</p><p>Many “aha” moments are feature-dependent. If customers fail to use those features, they might technically be activated, but still not get the value they need.</p><p>Say a Lovable user needs to publish their app to a custom domain but doesn’t see that option. They might still publish the app, but they’ll likely get frustrated and churn. Had they discovered that feature, they’d probably have stayed.</p><p>Feature adoption is a powerful lever for retention. I usually come at it from two angles:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Top-down:</strong> Identify the top 5–10 features you believe are critical to deliver product value. If adoption of those is low, you might have a discovery issue, most likely caused by feature bloat or lack of feature visibility.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bottom-up</strong>: Look at your most retentive users and identify the features they use consistently. Take the ones that correlate with long-term retention and try to increase feature adoption for relevant users.</p></li></ol><p>Combine these two approaches and you’ll end up with a list of features to focus your efforts on.</p><p>At the same time, you’ll get clarity on the features you need to sunset. Every horizontal platform needs to implement ongoing cleanup. Consider setting a feature kill list to identify underused features and prioritize their deprecation - <em>unless</em> usage can be lifted.

It usually comes down to payment failures, often caused by expired cards or tight fraud controls.</p><p>If you’re not managing involuntary churn via retries and recovery flows, you’re leaving money on the table.</p><p>You don’t need to figure this out on your own. Tools like<a href=\"https://churnkey.co/\"> Churnkey</a> integrate directly with your billing provider to recover revenue you’d otherwise miss. For larger companies, this adds up quickly.</p><p>That said, don’t mistake payment recovery for a retention strategy. It’s ibuprofen for the symptom, not a fix for the root cause of your headache.</p><h2><strong>Finally, try resurrecting the churned users</strong></h2><p>Most companies give up on churned users way too quickly.</p><p>But if your churned base is big enough, resurrection tactics should be a priority. Think of it this way: if you’re converting 5% of new users, reactivating even 1–2% of past ones can deliver similar (or better) results.</p><p>But resurrection needs to be strategic.</p><p>Generic “we miss you” emails don’t bring people back from the dead.</p><p>What they do is ignoring a key point: your product is constantly evolving. Churned users likely have an outdated idea of what your product is and what it can do. That’s your opportunity to show them the value you’ve added in the meantime.</p><p>Segment churned users into two groups:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Churned but still active</strong> (free tier users): They’re the perfect candidates for a trial restarts. But do it on your timeline, not theirs. On your next big product launch, grant them access to the paid plan. Let the product do the talking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Truly inactive users:</strong> You still have one major advantage: their contact information. But approach it carefully. A well-timed drip campaign, trial restarts every few months, can highlight new capabilities without overwhelming them. The goal is to show them that the product has changed, and might finally solve what they originally needed.</p></li></ol><p>Resurrection isn’t a replacement for acquisition, but it’s a powerful complement, especially for mature companies with a large churn base and a steady stream of improvements.</p><h2><strong>A note on team structure</strong></h2><p>If you want a shot at fighting churn, you need the right teams in the<a href=\"https://www.elenaverna.com/p/how-to-sequence-your-growth-squads\"> right sequence</a>.</p><p>Begin with a squad that owns activation. At the same time, the core Product team and Marketing should work on feature adoption and utilization.</p><p>Sometimes this starts as a lifecycle marketing team focused on messaging and email touchpoints. But over time, product and engineering usually join, especially if you want to tackle payment recovery, off-boarding flows, and resurrection initiatives with real depth.</p><p>In many cases, these efforts sit within the same pod. And they should. Churn isn't a single metric problem, it’s a cross-functional one. Your structure needs to reflect that.</p><h2><strong>Churn is…feedback</strong></h2><p>Churn isn’t just a retention problem. It shows you what users didn’t understand or didn’t value your product, despite your best efforts.</p><p>You can ignore that signal, throw a few painkillers at it, and hope it gets better.</p><p>Or you can treat churn like what it really is: your most honest feedback loop.</p><p><em>Edited with the help of <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianafbernardo/\">Diana Bernardo</a>.</em></p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.elenaverna.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\"><strong>If you’re finding this newsletter valuable, share it with a friend, and consider subscribing if you haven’t already.
